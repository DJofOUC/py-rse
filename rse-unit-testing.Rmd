## Introduction {#rse-unit-testing-intro}

When you write software, 
you likely think your code is doing exactly what you wrote it to do.
But how do you *know* for sure, in a quantifiable and objective way?
How do you know if your code correctly outputs or computes what you think it does?
Well, like in science, to find out if something matches your expectation, 
you test that expectation against reality.
In this case, you write tests for your code to validate (or invalidate) your expectation.
Over the course of this chapter we will explain and show how to make use of
["unit tests"](glossary.html#rse-unit-testing-test) in both Python and R packages.

## Manually testing your code {#rse-unit-testing-manual-testing}

Without a formal framework for testing code, 
how do you normally see if your code works?
Like many of us before learning about unit testing, 
you might test code interactively by running it yourself on different problems.

For instance, let's say you wrote a function like this:

```{r}
# in R
numSign <- function(x) {
  if (x > 0) {
    1
  } else {
    -1
  }
}

numSign(1)
```

```{python}
# In Python
def numSign(x):
    if x > 0:
        out = 1
    else:
        out = -1
    return(out)

numSign(1)
```

A simple way to test the code is to run commands like:

```{r}
numSign(2) == 1
numSign(0) == -1
numSign(-4) == -1
```

You could go a step further and write a script with some simple tests:

```{r}
# In R
stopifnot(numSign(1) == 1)
stopifnot(numSign(-Inf) == -1)
```

`stopifnot()` runs the code and if it resolves to `true` than it continues.
What if you want to test something that you know should fail?

```{r, error=TRUE}
stopifnot(numSign(NULL) == -1)
```

Which gives an error as expected.

TODO: Finish this off...

### Exercise

- e0: Write in the console to check if it has an error or gives you what you expect.

### Why this quickly becomes a problem

Writing simple tests on the fly and interactively (or informally), like above, 
works for a while but quickly becomes unsustainable. 
The above are not sufficient because:

1. If you run the simple tests in a script that causes an error,
the execution will halt at the first failed test.
Any subsequent test won't then run and we may not know if the error was expected or not.

2. The tests are not independent, given that if one test fails, 
all subsequent tests won't be run.
Good tests are independent of each other,
so that all tests run and give an output on their success or failure.

3. Each test prints the output to the screen (true/false... or no output at all),
but there is no overall summary and no easy way to see what test produced what result.
For only three tests like above, this isn't a problem.
But once more tests are included and given no meaningful output is provided,
this way of creating tests becomes unusable.

Instead, we should use a formal framework for writing and running tests.

## Framework for automatic testing {#rse-unit-testing-framework}

To optimize your time writing code and developing tests, 
a framework for testing software should:

- make it easy for people to write tests (because otherwise they won't do it);
- run a set of tests;
- report which ones have failed; and,
- give some idea of where or why they failed (to help debugging).

Any single test can have one of three results:

- [success](glossary.html#test-success), meaning that the test passed correctly;
- [failure](glossary.html#test-failure), meaning that the software being tested didn't do what it was supposed to; or
- [error](glossary.html#test-error), meaning that the test itself failed (in which case, we don't know anything about the software being tested).

A formal [test framework](glossary.html#test-framework) is a package that supports writing and running tests.
In Python, the tools to run the tests are called a [test runner](glossary.html#test-runner).
The package will find the tests, execute them, and report the results of the tests.
If any test fails, a summary of the failure will be given.

Tests in this framework are usually called "unit tests",
where individual components ("units") of your code are tested.
A unit test is a function that runs your code (with associated tests) and produces one of the three results.
Unit tests take an input (called a [fixture](glossary.html#fixture) in Python and simply "input" in R) 
that are then sent to the functions or code we want to test.
For each function/code we have a set of test "expectations",
meaning that we compare our expected output of the function/code with what the code actually outputs.

## Getting tests set up {#rse-unit-testing-getting-setup}

There are several test frameworks in both Python and R. 
In Python, the most recommended and most common package is [pytest][pytest].
In R, it is the testthat package.

We'll start with **Python**.
Tests in pytest are structured according to three simple rules:

1. All tests are put in files whose names begin with `test_`.
2. Each test is a function whose name begins with `test_`.
3. Test functions use `assert` to check that results are as expected.

It's good practice to put all test files into the `tests/` folder. 
Running tests is done by typing in the shell:

```shell
pytest
```

pytest searches for all files named `test_*.py` or `*_test.py` in the current directory and its sub-directories (e.g. `tests/`).
If we want to run single tests, we run the command `pytest tests/test_filename.py` to run the tests in file `tests/test_filename.py`.
We'll get into the specific anatomy of unit tests in the next section.

**For R**, setting things up are a bit more straight-forward and automated. 
To start, open the `.Rproj` in RStudio. In the console, type out:

```r
usethis::use_testthat()
```

which will create a new `tests/testthat/` directory, 
add testthat to `Suggests` in the `DESCRIPTION` file,
and creates a `tests/testthat.R` script that instructs R on how to run the tests.
Creating a new test file is done with:

```r
usethis::use_test("name-of-file")
```

which will create a file called `tests/testthat/test-name-of-file.R`. 
Generally, the name of the test file should reflect what you want to test,
usually the contents of a specific R file inside `R/`.
The basic template for writing the test is provided inside the new file.

Running tests in R is done by either typing out:

```r
devtools::test()
```

or by using the keybinding "Ctrl/Cmd-Shift-T" in RStudio.
For further learning on using unit tests in R packages, check out the
[`testthat`][r-testthat] website and the [Testing Chapter][r-pkg-book-testing] of
the [R Packages][r-pkg-book] book.

### Exercise

**In Python**:

- Create a file called `test_add_two.py` in `tests/` by running in the terminal:

    ```shell
    touch tests/test_add_two.py
    ```
    
    Open that file in the Python editor and write (or copy and paste) the below code into the file:
    
    TODO: Fix editor name here.
    
    ```python
    def add_two(x, y):
        val = x + y
        return(val)
    
    # This will succeed
    def test_add_two():
        assert add_two(1, 2) == 3
    
    # This will fail    
    def test_add_two_fail():
        assert add_two(1, 2) == 4
    ```
    
    TODO: Make sure this is correct.
    
    Now, run `pytest` in the terminal. What does the test results say?

**In R**:

- Making sure you are inside your R package in RStudio, 
type out `usethis::use_testthat()` to set up testing if you haven't done already.
Next run the command:

    ```r
    usethis::use_test("mean")
    ```
    
    The new test file should open up in RStudio. 
    Write out (or copy and paste) the below code into the new file:
    
    ```r
    context("Computing the mean")
    
    test_that("the mean is calculated correctly", {
        # This will succeed
        expect_identical(mean(1:10), 5.5)
        
        # This won't
        expect_identical(mean(1:10), 4.5)
    })
    ```
    
    Run the tests using "Ctrl-Shift-T". What does the test results say?
    
## Anatomy of a unit test {#rse-unit-testing-anatomy-test}

Unit tests all have a similar and basic structure:

- Loading the packages and setting up any necessary inputs/fixtures.
- Setting up the test function ("expectation") with the code and its expected out.

So template of how it looks like would be (for Python):

```python
from package import function

def test_name():
    assert function(fixture) == expectation

# and so on...
```

Load the function from the package, write the test name, set the function name
with an input/fixture, and test against the expectation.

In R, it would be:

```r
context("Short description of what is being tested")
library(package)

test_that("short description of what is expected", {
  expect_equal(function_name(input), expectation)
})
```

The `context()` is the short explanation, or documentation, 
on what the is reason for doing the test.
We'll cover writing these more in later sections.
When writing `test_that()` unit tests, 
the description part should be read as, e.g. "test that... the mean is correct".
Then all tests inside the `test_that()` function should be related to the description.
The testthat package has a ton of `expect_*` functions,
which can be easily browsed by typing `testthat::expect_` and then hitting TAB for autocompletion and listing.

### Exercise

Using the tests created from the previous exercise, 
fix the code so that all tests will succeed.
Then re-run the tests (`pytest` or `devtools::test()`) and confirm that the tests passed.

### Exercise

**In Python**:

**In R**:

- Create a new test by running `usethis::use_test("")`. Write out (or copy and
paste) the code below into the newly created test file. Fill in the blank

TODO: Complete

## Describing and developing unit tests {#rse-unit-testing-develop-tests}

TODO: Better title?



### Exercise

- **In Python**:
TODO: Is there an equivalent?

- **In R**: Look at the test below. 
Based on the contents, write appropriate `context()` 
and `test_that()` messages by filling in the blanks. 
There are no right answers, only more descriptive or less descriptive messages.

    ```r
    context("___")
    
    test_that("___", {
    
    })
    ```


### Exercise

- Create a new test file. Then, write a unit test to check if
(in R, use a single `test_that()`):
    - 
    
TODO: Have coherence with functions they previously created? Or stand-alone?

## Testing both code success *and* failure {#rse-unit-testing-test-failure}

It might not seems important, but testing how your code *fails* is just as important as when it *succeeds*.
Knowing how and when you code fails (outputs an error) is good practice,
as it forces you to think about how a user might interact with your software
and if your code actually fails when you write that it should.
So our tests should actually include checks on expected errors too.

In **Python**, we can test for an error by using:


```python
import pytest

def test_text_not_empty():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        count_words('')
```

This test includes the `pytest.raises` function to handle tests that checks for errors.
We use `pytest.raises()` with Python's `with` keyword to indicate an expectation
of an error in the code and to have the test fail if an error isn't raised.

In **R**, there are specific testthat functions to test for errors (`expect_error()`)
or warnings (`expect_warning()`):

```r
test_that("count words throws an error", {
    expect_error(count_words(""))
})
```

### Exercise

- Using the same process as we've covered 
(i.e. making a new test file, setting up the basic template of the test),
create a new test to check when code should throw an error. 
Create the test for a function from your R or Python package you haven't tested yet.

## Checking what code is tested {#rse-unit-testing-coverage}

Take a moment to study the code shown below,
and see if you can tell which lines will be executed or not.

In **Python**:

```python
def first(left, right):
    if left < right:
        left, right = right, left
    while left > right:
        value = second(left, right)
        left, right = right, int(right/2)
    return value

def second(check, balance):
    if check > 0:
        return balance
    else:
        return 0

def main():
    final = first(3, 5)
    print(3, 5, final)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

In **R**:

```{r}
first <- function(left, right) {
  if (left < right) {
    tmp <- left
    left <- right
    right <- tmp
  }
  
  while (left > right) {
    value <- second(left, right)
    left <- right
    right <- as.integer(right / 2)
  }
  
  value
}

second <- function(check, balance) {
    if (check > 0)
        balance
    else
        0
}

c(3, 5, first(3, 5))
```


You probably have a hard time figuring out which lines of code were executed and which weren't.
As you start using more conditionals in your code, 
its good practice to test cases when those conditionals get activated.
There is a tool called code [coverage](glossary.html#coverage) 
to help see how much of your code gets executed by your tests,
which is especially useful with tracking conditional activation.
Code coverage measures which parts of your program are and are not executed.
Essentially, a code coverage tool tracks the progress of execution through the code
and identifies which lines of all the lines gets executed.
After the program finishes, code coverage tells you what lines were not executed,
and what percentage was.

Use this tool to make sure a large portion of your code gets tested.
But note, there is no "magic percentage" for how much [test coverage](glossary.html#test-coverage) to have.
It's good to try getting as high a coverage as you can, 
since anything that *isn't* tested may likely be wrong,
while balancing writing tests and writing code.
It usually isn't necessary to get 100% code coverage.

use `coverage run filename.py` instead of `python filename.py` to run your program.
This creates a file in the current directory called `.coverage`;
once your program completes,
you can run `coverage report` to get a summary of the most recent report:

```shell
$ coverage run demo_coverage.py
```
```text
Name               Stmts   Miss  Cover
--------------------------------------
demo_coverage.py      16      1    94%
```

If you want the details,
you can use `coverage html` to generate an HTML listing.

**R** has similar functionality. 
The covr package has several functions for checking coverage.
Given that you've developed a package throughout this course, 
the more appropriate function to use is:

```r
covr::package_coverage()
```

(covr also has an [RStudio Addin][rstudio-addin] that gives quick access to this command.)

This function will output a list of all R files in the package,
with their corresponding percentage coverage. 
This can give a good overview of where you might need to improve your testing.

## What to test and when {#rse-unit-testing-what-when}

So far we've discussed *how* to test and *why* to test, but we haven't really 
covered *what* should we test and *when* do we start testing. 
Here are two things to think about when writing tests:

1. No amount of testing can prove the code is completely correct. 
For a function with only a few arguments, 
there may be dozens of possible combinations of inputs.
You can't test all these possible inputs. 
Nor can we write tests correctly all the time (we are only human, who make mistakes).
Writing tests should focus on what is *most likely* going to be input 
and what the software was intended for.

2. Many test cases can be grouped into "classes" of tests. 
For instance, functions with numbers as input could theoretically only need to test a few cases:
infinity (`Inf`), missing values, and one or two tests on intended use.
We may miss unique use cases for our functions when we test this way,
but it makes it easier as the developer 
and as the reader of the code if tests are grouped according to classes.

One topic that often comes up when looking into unit testing is the practice of 
[test-driven development](glossary.html#tdd) (TDD).
Rather than writing code and then writing tests,
TDD advocates suggest to write tests first so we know what the code is supposed to do,
and then write just enough code to make those tests pass.
Once the code works, clean it up and commit it, then move on to the next task.

TDD's advocates claim that this approach emphasizes a focus on what the code should do
so that the developer isn't subject to confirmation bias when viewing the test results.
They also claim that TDD ensures that code actually *is* testable,
and that tests are actually written.
However, the evidence backing these claims is contradictory.
Try TDD out and try to find out what works best for you and your specific problems.

## Final exercise {#rse-unit-testing-final-exercise}

1. Write unit tests for all functions you created from previous chapters on Zipf's Law.
Try to think how a user may use your functions and write tests reflecting that.
2. Run code coverage on your package. What is the percentage coverage? 
Is there any way you could write more comprehensive unit tests to increase coverage?
Try to write more to get the coverage higher.
