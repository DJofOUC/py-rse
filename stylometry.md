The second project is a simple form of [computational stylometry](glossary.html#computational-stylometry).
Different writers have different styles;
can a computer detect those differences,
and if so,
can it determine who the likely author of a text actually was?
Computational stylometry has been used to explore
which parts of Shakespeare's plays might have been written by other people,
which presidential tweets were composed by other people,
and who wrote incriminating emails in several high-profile legal cases.

The authors of our books are listed below.
Three of them were purportedly written by Jane Austen;
we will see if the similarity measures we develop show that.
