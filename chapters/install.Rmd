# Setting Up {#install}

## Software {#install-software}

In order to complete the activities in this book,
the following software is required:

1. a \gref{Bash shell}{shell}
2. \gref{Git}{git} version control
3. a text editor
4. Python 3 (via the Anaconda distribution)
5. [GNU Make][gnu-make]

Software installation instructions for Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems
(with video tutorials) are maintained by [The Carpentries][carpentries]
as part of their workshop website template:  
<https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#setup>

Follow those instructions to install the bash shell, Git, a text editor and Anaconda.

If Make is not already installed on your computer (type `make -v` into the Bash shell to check): 

- *Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)*: Install it from the Bash shell using `sudo apt-get install make`.
- *Mac*: Install [Xcode][xcode] (via the App Store).
- *Windows*: Follow the [installation instructions][ubc-mds-make-windows] maintained by the
  Master of Data Science at the University of British Columbia.

> **conda in the shell on windows**
>
> If you are using Windows and the `conda` command isn’t available at the Bash shell,
> you’ll need to open the Anaconda Prompt program (via the Windows start menu)
> and run the command `conda init bash` (this only needs to be done once).
> After that, your shell will be configured to use conda going forward.

## Configuring Git to use Nano {#install-git-nano}
