The more software we write,
the more we think of a programming language as a way to build and combine libraries.
Every widely-used language now has an online repository
from which people can download and install those libraries.
This lesson shows you how to use Python's tools to create and share libraries of your own.

We will continue with our Zipf's Law project,
which should include the following files:

## Creating a Python Package {#packaging-package}

A package consists of one or more Python source files\index{Python package!structure}
in a specific directory structure
combined with installation instructions for the computer.
Python packages can come from various sources:
some are distributed with Python itself,
but anyone can create one,
and there are thousands that can be downloaded and installed from online repositories.

> **Terminology**
>
> People sometimes refer to packages as modules.\index{Python package vs.\ module}
> Strictly speaking,
> a module is a single source file,
> while a package is a directory structure that contains one or more modules.

A generic package folder hierarchy looks like this:

```text
pkg_name
├── pkg_name
│   ├── module1.py
│   └── module2.py
├── README.md
└── setup.py
```

The top-level directory is named after the package.
It contains a directory that is also named after the package,
and that contains the package's source files.
It is initially a little confusing to have two directories with the same name,
but most Python projects follow this convention because
it makes it easier to set up the project for installation.
We can get this structure in our Zipf's Law project
by renaming `zipf/bin` to `zipf`.

> **`__init__.py`**
>
> Python packages often contain a file with a special name:
> `__init__.py`\index{\_\_init\_\_.py file (in Python package)}\index{Python package!\_\_init\_\_.py file}
> (two underscores before and after `init`).
> Just as importing a module file executes the code in the module,
> importing a package executes the code in `__init__.py`.
> Packages *had* to have this file before Python 3.3,
> even if it was empty,
> but since Python 3.3 it is only needed
> if we want to run some code as the package is being imported.

To make the modules in the Zipf's Law project work as a Python package,
we only need to make one important change to the code itself:
changing the syntax for how we import `utilities`.
Currently,
both `collate.py` and `countwords.py` contains this line:

```python
import utilities
```

This is called an
[implicit relative import][implicit_relative_import],\index{Python!import!implicit relative}\index{implicit relative import (in Python)}
because it is not clear whether we mean
"import a Python package called `utilities`"
or
"import a file in our local directory called `utilities.py`"
(which is what we want).
To remove this ambiguity we need to be explicit and write:

```python
from zipf import utilities
```

This is an
[absolute import][absolute_import],\index{Python!import!absolute}\index{absolute import (in Python)}
since we are specifying the full location of `utilities` inside the `zipf` package.
Absolute imports are the preferred way for parts of a package to import other parts,
but we can also use
[explicit relative imports][explicit_relative_import],\index{Python!import!explicit relative}\index{explicit relative import (in Python)}
which require a little less typing
and can sometimes make it easier to restructure very large projects:

```python
from . import utilities
```

Here,
the `.` signals that `utilities` exists in the current directory.

Python has several ways to build an installable package.\index{Python package!building}
We will show how to use [setuptools][setuptools],\index{setuptools (in Python)}\index{Python!setuptools}
which is the lowest common denominator
and will allow everyone,
regardless of what Python distribution they have,
to use our package.
To use `setuptools`,
we must create a file called `setup.py` in the directory *above* the root directory of the package.
(This is why we require the two-level directory structure described earlier.)
`setup.py` must have exactly that name,
and must contain lines like these:

```python
from setuptools import setup


setup(
    name='zipf',
    version='0.1.0',
    author='Amira Khan',
    packages=['zipf'])
```

The `name` and `author` parameters are self-explanatory.
Most software projects use [semantic versioning][semantic_versioning]\index{semantic versioning}\index{Python package!semantic versioning}
for software releases.
A version number consists of three integers X.Y.Z,
where X is the major version,\index{software version number}
Y is the minor version,
and Z is the [patch][patch] version.\index{patch (of software version)}
Major version zero (0.Y.Z) is for initial development, so we have started with 0.1.0.
The first stable public release would be version 1.0.0,
and in general, the version number is incremented as follows:

-   Increment `major` every time there's an incompatible externally-visible change
-   Increment `minor` when adding new functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
    (i.e. without breaking any existing code)
-   Increment `patch` for backwards-compatible bug fixes that don't add any new features

Finally,
we specify the name of the directory
containing the code to be packaged with the `packages` parameter.
This is straightforward in our case because we only have a single package directory.
For more complex projects,
the [`find_packages`][find-packages] function from `setuptools`
can automatically find all packages by recursively searching the current directory.

## Virtual Environments {#packaging-virtualenv}

We can add additional information to our package later,
but this is enough to be able to build it for testing purposes.
Before we do that,
though,
we should create a [virtual environment][virtual_environment]\index{virtual environment (in Python)}\index{Python!virtual environment}
to test how our package installs
without breaking anything in our main Python installation.

A virtual environment is a layer on top of an existing Python installation.
Whenever Python needs to find a package,
it looks in the virtual environment before checking the main Python installation.
This gives us a place to install packages that only some projects need
without affecting other projects.

Virtual environments also help with package development:

-   We want to be able to easily test install and uninstall our package,
    without affecting the entire Python environment.
-   We want to answer problems people have with our package with something more helpful than
    "I don't know, it works for me".
    By installing and running our package in a completely empty environment,
    we can ensure that we're not accidentally relying on other packages being installed.

We can manage virtual environments using [conda][conda] (Appendix \@ref(anaconda)).
To create a new virtual environment called `zipf` we run `conda create`,\index{virtual environment (in Python)!creating}
specifying the environment's name with the `-n` or `--name` flag
and listing `python` as the base to build on:

```shell
$ conda create -n zipf python
```

```text
Collecting package metadata (current_repodata.json): done
Solving environment: done

## Package Plan ##

  environment location: /home/amira/anaconda3/envs/zipf

...

Proceed ([y]/n)? y

...

Executing transaction: done
#
# To activate this environment, use
#
#     $ conda activate zipf
#
# To deactivate an active environment, use
#
#     $ conda deactivate
```

`conda` creates the directory `~/anaconda3/envs/zipf`,
which contains the subdirectories needed for a minimal Python installation,
such as `bin` and `lib`.
It also creates `~/anaconda3/envs/zipf/bin/python`,
which checks for packages in these directories before checking the main installation.

We can switch to the `zipf` environment by running:\index{virtual environment (in Python)!switching}

```shell
$ conda activate zipf
```

Once we have done this,
the `python` command runs the interpreter in `zipf/bin`:

```shell
(zipf)$ which python
```

```text
/home/amira/anaconda3/envs/zipf/bin/python
```

Notice that every shell command displays `(zipf)` when that virtual environment is active.
Between Git branches and virtual environments,
it can be very easy to lose track of what exactly we are working on and with.
Prompts like this can make it a little less confusing;
using virtual environment names that match the names of your projects
(and branches, if you're testing different environments on different branches)
quickly becomes essential.

We can now install packages safely.
Everything we install will go into `zipf` virtual environment
without affecting the underlying Python installation.
When we are done,
we can switch back to the default environment using `conda deactivate`:

```shell
(zipf)$ conda deactivate

```
```shell
$ which python
```

```text
/usr/bin/python
```

## Installing a Development Package {#packaging-installing}

Let's install our package inside this virtual environment.\index{Python package!installation}
First we re-activate it:

```shell
$ conda activate zipf
```

Next,
we go into the upper `zipf` directory that contains our `setup.py` file
and install our package using `pip install -e .`.
The `-e` option indicates that we want to to install the package in "editable" mode,
which means that any changes we make in the package code are directly available to use
without having to reinstall the package;
the `.` means "install from the current directory":

```text
(zipf)$ cd zipf
(zipf)$ pip install -e .
```

```text

Successfully built zipf
Installing collected packages: zipf
Successfully installed zipf-0.1.0
```

If we look in `~/anaconda3/envs/zipf/lib/python3.8/site-packages/`,
we can see the `zipf` package beside all the other locally-installed packages.
If we try to use the package at this stage,
though,
Python will complain that some of the packages it depends on,
such as `pandas`,
are not installed.
We could install these manually,
but it is more reliable to automate this process
by listing everything that our package depends on
using the `install_requires` parameter in `setup.py`:

```python
from setuptools import setup


setup(
    name='zipf',
    version='0.1',
    author='Amira Khan',
    packages=['zipf'],
    install_requires=[
        'matplotlib',
        'pandas',
        'scipy',
        'pyyaml',
        'pytest'])
```

We don't have to list `numpy` explicitly
because it will be installed as a dependency for `pandas` and `scipy`.\index{dependency!package}

> **Versioning Dependencies**
>
> It is good practice to specify the versions of our dependencies
> and even better to specify version ranges.
> For example, if we have only tested our package on pandas version 1.0.1,
> we could put `pandas==1.0.1` or `pandas>=1.0.1` instead of just `pandas`
> in the list argument passed to the `install_requires` parameter.

We can now install our package and all its dependencies in a single command:

```shell
(zipf)$ pip install -e .
```

```

(The precise output of this command will change
depending on which versions of our dependencies get installed.)

We can now import our package in a script or a Jupyter notebook
just as we would any other package.
For example,
to use the function in `utilities`,
we would write:

```python
from zipf import utilities


utilities.collection_to_csv(...)
```

However,
the useful command-line scripts that we used to count and plot word counts
are no longer accessible directly from the terminal.
Fortunately,
the `setuptools` package allows us to install programs along with the package.\index{Python package!installing programs}
These programs are placed beside those of other packages.
We tell `setuptools` to do this by defining
[entry points][entry_point]:\index{entry point (in Python package)}\index{Python package!entry point}

```python
from setuptools import setup


setup(
    name='zipf',
    version='0.1',
    author='Amira Khan',
    packages=['zipf'],
    install_requires=[
        'matplotlib',
        'pandas',
        'scipy',
        'pyyaml',
        'pytest'],
    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': [
            'countwords = zipf.countwords:main',
            'collate = zipf.collate:main',
            'plotcounts = zipf.plotcounts:main']})
```

The right side of the `=` operator is the location of a function,
written as `package.module:function`;
the left side is the name we want to use to call this function from the command line.
In this case we want to call each module's `main`,
which as it stands requires an input argument `args`
containing the command-line arguments given by the user (Section \@ref(scripting-options)).
For example,
the relevant section of our `countwords.py` program is:

```python
def main(args):
    """Run the command line program."""
    with args.infile as reader:
        word_counts = count_words(reader)
    utilities.collection_to_csv(word_counts, num=args.num)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=__doc__)
    parser.add_argument('infile', type=argparse.FileType('r'), nargs='?',
                        default='-', help='Input file name')
    parser.add_argument('-n', '--num', type=int, default=None,
                        help='Limit output to N most frequent words')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    main(args)
```

We can't pass any arguments to `main` when we define entry points in our `setup.py` file,
so we need to change this slightly:

```python
def parse_command_line():
    """Parse the command line for input arguments."""
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=__doc__)
    parser.add_argument('infile', type=argparse.FileType('r'), nargs='?',
                        default='-', help='Input file name')
    parser.add_argument('-n', '--num', type=int, default=None,
                        help='Limit output to N most frequent words')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    return args

def main():
    """Run the command line program."""
    args = parse_command_line()
    with args.infile as reader:
        word_counts = count_words(reader)
    utilities.collection_to_csv(word_counts, num=args.num)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Once we have made the corresponding change in `collate.py` and `plotcounts.py`,
we can re-install our package:

```shell
(zipf)$ pip install -e .
```

The output looks slightly different than the first run
because `pip` could re-use some packages saved locally by the previous install
rather than re-fetching them from online repositories.
(If we hadn't used the `-e` option to make the package immediately editable,
we would have to uninstall it before reinstalling it during development.)

We can now use our commands directly from the terminal
without writing the full path to the file
and without prefixing it with `python`.

```shell

```

## What Installation Does {#packaging-installation}

Now that we have created and installed a Python package,
let's explore what actually happens during installation.\index{Python package!installation}
The short version is that
the contents of the package are copied into a directory that Python will search
when it imports things.
In theory we can "install" packages by manually copying source code into the right places,
but it's much more efficient and safer to use a tool specifically made for this purpose,
such as `conda` or `pip`.

Most of the time,
these tools copy packages into the Python installation's `site-packages` directory,\index{Python!site-packages directory}
but this is not the only place Python searches.
Just as the `PATH` environment in the shell contains a list of directories
that the shell searches for programs it can execute (Section \@ref(bash-advanced-vars)),
the Python variable `sys.path` contains a list of the directories it searches.
We can look at this list inside the interpreter:

```python
import sys
sys.path
```

```
['',
'/home/amira/anaconda3/envs/zipf/lib/python37.zip',
'/home/amira/anaconda3/envs/zipf/lib/python3.7',
'/home/amira/anaconda3/envs/zipf/lib/python3.7/lib-dynload',
'/home/amira/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages',
'/home/amira/anaconda3/envs/zipf/lib/python3.7/site-packages',
'/home/amira/zipf']
```

The empty string at the start of the list means "the current directory".
The rest are system paths for our Python installation,
and will vary from computer to computer.

## Distributing Packages {#packaging-distribute}

Now that our package can be installed,
we should distribute it so that anyone can run `pip install zipf`\index{Python package!distribution}
and start use it.
To do this,
we need to use `setuptools` to create
a [source distribution][source_distribution]\index{source distribution (of Python package)}\index{Python package!source distribution}
(known as an `sdist` in Python packaging jargon):

```shell
python setup.py sdist
```

```text

```

These distribution files can now be distributed via [PyPI][pypi],
the standard repository for Python packages.
Before doing that,
though,
we can put `zipf` on [TestPyPI][testpypi],
which lets us test distribution of our package\index{Python package!testing distribution}
without having things appear in the main PyPI repository.
We must have an account,
but they are free to create.

The preferred tool for uploading packages to PyPI is called [twine][twine],
which we can install with:

```shell
$ pip install twine
```

Following the [Python Packaging User Guide][pypi-user-guide],
we can now upload our distributions from the `dist/` folder
using the `--repository` option to specify the TestPyPI repository:

```shell
$ twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
Enter your username: amirakhan
Enter your passowrd: *********
Uploading distributions to https://test.pypi.org/legacy/

```

We have now uploaded both types of distribution,
allowing people to use the wheel distribution if their system supports it
or the source distribution if it does not.
We can test that this has worked
by creating a virtual environment
and installing our package from TestPyPI:

```shell
$ conda create -n zipf-test
$ conda activate zipf-test
(zipf-test)$ pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple zipf

Once again,
`pip` takes advantage of the fact that some packages already existing on our system
and doesn't download them again.
Once we are happy with how our package appears in TestPyPI
(including its [project page][zipf-project-page]),\index{Python package!project page}\index{project page (of Python package)}
we can go through the same process to put it on the main [PyPI][pypi] repository.

## Documenting Packages {#packaging-document}

An old proverb says, "Trust, but verify."
The equivalent in programming is, "Be clear, but document."
No matter how well software is written,
it always embodies decisions that aren't explicit in the final code
or accommodates complications that aren't going to be obvious to the next reader.
Putting it another way,
the best function names in the world aren't going to answer the questions
"Why does the software do this?"
and
"Why doesn't it do this in a simpler way?"

It's important to consider who documentation is for.
There are three kinds of people in any domain:
[novices][novice],
[competent practitioners][competent_practitioner],
and [experts][expert] @Wils2018.
A novice doesn't yet have a [mental model][mental_model] of the domain:
they don't know what the key terms are,
how they relate,
what the causes of their problems are,
or how to tell whether a solution to their problem is appropriate or not.

Competent practitioners know enough to accomplish routine tasks with routine effort:
they may need to check [Stack Overflow][stack-overflow] every few minutes,
but they know what to search for and what "done" looks like.
Finally,
experts have such a deep and broad understanding of the domain
that they can solve routine problems at a glance
and are able to handle the one-in-a-thousand cases
that would baffle the merely competent.

Each of these three groups needs a different kind of documentation:

-   A novice needs a tutorial that introduces her to key ideas one by one
    and shows how they fit together.

-   A competent practitioner needs reference guides, cookbooks, and Q&A sites;
    these give her solutions close enough to what she needs
    that she can tweak them the rest of the way.

-   Experts need this material as well---nobody's memory is perfect---but
    they may also paradoxically want tutorials.
    The difference between them and novices is that experts want tutorials on how things work
    and why they were designed that way.

The first thing to decide when writing documentation
is therefore to decide which of these needs we are trying to meet.
Tutorials like this one should be long-form prose that contain code samples and diagrams.
They should use [authentic tasks][authentic_task] to motivate ideas,
i.e.,
show people things they actually want to do rather than printing the numbers from 1 to 10,
and should include regular check-ins
so that learners and instructors alike can tell if they're making progress.

Tutorials help novices build a mental model,
but competent practitioners and experts will be frustrated by their slow pace and low information density.
They will want single-point solutions to specific problems like
how to find cells in a spreadsheet that contain a certain string
or how to configure the web server to load an access control module.
They can make use of an alphabetical list of the functions in a library,
but are much happier if they can search by keyword to find what they need;
one of the signs that someone is no longer a novice is that
they're able to compose useful queries and tell if the results are on the right track or not.

> **False Beginners**
>
> A [false beginner][false_beginner] is someone who appears not to know anything,
> but who has enough prior experience in other domains
> to be able to piece things together much more quickly than a genuine novice.
> Someone who is proficient with MATLAB, for example,
> will speed through a tutorial on Python's numerical libraries
> much more quickly than someone who has never programmed before.
> Creating documentation for false beginners is especially challenging;
> if resources permit,
> the best option is often a translation guide

> and then how to do the equivalent task with the new system.


In an ideal world,
we would satisfy these needs with a [chorus of explanations][caulfield-chorus],
some long and detailed,
others short and to the point.
In our world, though,
time and resources are limited,
so all but the most popular packages must make do with single explanations.
The next sections of this chapter will therefore look at:

* Writing good docstrings
* Using the `README` to provide an overview of the package
* Automatically generating a reference guide as a webpage
* Hosting documentation online
* Leveraging existing solutions to provide an FAQ

### Writing Good Docstrings {#packaging-docstrings}

If we are doing [exploratory programming][exploratory_programming],
a short [docstring][docstring] to remind ourselves of each function's purpose\index{docstring (in Python)}\index{Python!docstring}
is probably as much documentation as we need.
(In fact, it's probably better than what most people do.)
That one- or two-liner should begin with an active verb and describe either
how inputs are turned into outputs,
or what side effects the function has;
as we discuss below,
if we need to describe both,
we should probably rewrite our function.

An active verb is something like "extract", "normalize", or "find".
For example,
these are all good one-line docstrings:

-   "Create a list of current ages from a list of birth dates."
-   "Clip signals to lie in [0...1]."
-   "Reduce the red component of each pixel."

We can tell our one-liners are useful if we can read them aloud in the order the functions are called
in place of the function's name and parameters.

Once we start writing code for other people (or our future selves)
our docstrings should include:

1.  The name and purpose of every public class, function, and constant in our code.
2.  The name, purpose, and default value (if any) of every parameter to every function.
3.  Any side effects the function has.
4.  The type of value returned by every function.
5.  What exceptions those functions can raise and when.

The word "public" in the first rule is important.
We don't have to write full documentation for helper functions
that are only used inside our package and aren't meant to be called by users,
but these should still have at least a comment explaining their purpose.
We also don't have to document unit testing functions:
as discussed in Chapter \@ref(testing),
these should have long names that describe what they're checking
so that failure reports are easy to scan.

### Including Package Level Documentation in the `README` {#packaging-readme}

When a user first encounters a package,\index{Python package!documentation}
they usually want to know what the package is meant to do,
instructions on how to install it,
and examples of how to use it.
We can include these elements in the `README.md` file we started in Chapter \@ref(git-advanced).
At the moment it reads as follows:

```shell
$ cat README.md
```

```text
# Zipf's Law

These Zipf's Law scripts tally the occurrences of words in text files
and plot each word's rank versus its frequency.

## Contributors

- Amira Khan <amira@zipf.org>
- Sami Virtanen <sami@zipf.org>
```

This file is currently written in [Markdown][markdown]\index{Markdown}
because GitHub recognises files ending in `.md` and displays them nicely.
We could continue to do this,
but for a Python package we eventually want
to create a website for our package documentation (Section \@ref(packaging-sphinx)).
The most popular documentation generator in the Python community
uses a format called [reStructuredText][restructured_text] (reST),\index{reST (reStructured Text)}\index{reStructured Text (reST)}
so we will switch to that.

Like Markdown,
reST is a plain-text markup format
that can be rendered into HTML or PDF documents
with complex indices and cross-links.
GitHub recognizes files ending in `.rst` as reST files and displays them nicely,
so our first task is to rename our existing file:

```shell
$ git mv README.md README.rst
```

We then make a few edits to the file:
titles are underlined and overlined,
section headings are underlined,
and code blocks are set off with two colons (`::`) and indented:

```text
The ``zipf`` package tallies the occurrences of words in text files
and plots each word's rank versus its frequency
together with a line for the theoretical distribution for Zipf's Law.

Motivation
----------

Zipf’s Law is often stated as an observational pattern seen in the
relationship between the frequency and rank of words in a text:

`"…the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often
as the second most frequent word,
three times as often as the third most
frequent word, etc."`  
— `wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law>`_

Many books are available to download in plain text format
from sites such as `Project Gutenberg <https://www.gutenberg.org/>`_,
so we created this package to qualitatively explore how well different books align
with the word frequencies predicted by Zipf's Law.

Installation
------------

``pip install zipf``

Usage
-----

After installing this package,
the following three commands will be available from the command line

- ``countwords`` for counting the occurrences of words in a text.
- ``collate`` for collating multiple word count files together.
- ``plotcounts`` for visualizing the word counts.

A typical usage scenario would include running the following from your terminal::

    countwords dracula.txt > dracula.csv
    countwords moby_dick.txt > moby_dick.csv
    collate dracula.csv moby_dick.csv > collated.csv
    plotcounts collated.csv --outfile zipf-drac-moby.jpg

Additional information on each function
can be found in their docstrings and appending the ``-h`` flag,
e.g. ``countwords -h``.

### Creating a Web Page for Documentation {#packaging-sphinx}

Docstrings and READMEs are sufficient to describe most simple packages,
and are infinitely better than no documentation at all.
As our code base grows larger,
though,
we will want to complement these manually written sections with automatically generated content,
references between functions,
and search functionality.

The online documentation for most large Python packages
is generated using a tool called [Sphinx][sphinx],\index{Python package!documentation!Sphinx}
which is often used in combination with [Read The Docs][readthedocs],\index{Read The Docs (for Python documentation)}
a free service for hosting online documentation.
Let's install Sphinx and create a `docs/` directory at the top of our repository:

```shell
$ pip install sphinx
$ mkdir docs
$ cd docs
```

We can then run Sphinx's `quickstart` tool to create a minimal set of documentation
that includes the `README.rst` file we just created
and the docstrings we've written along the way.
It asks us to specify the project's name,
the name of the project's author,
and a release;
we can use the default settings for everything else.

```shell
$ sphinx-quickstart
```

```text
Welcome to the Sphinx 3.1.1 quickstart utility.

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

Selected root path: .

You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
"source" and "build" directories within the root path.
> Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]: n

The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
> Project name: zipf
> Author name(s): Amira Khan
> Project release []: 0.1

If the documents are to be written in a language other than English,
you can select a language here by its language code. Sphinx will then
translate text that it generates into that language.

For a list of supported codes, see
https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-language.
> Project language [en]:

Creating file /Users/amira/zipf/docs/conf.py.
Creating file /Users/amira/zipf/docs/index.rst.
Creating file /Users/amira/zipf/docs/Makefile.
Creating file /Users/amira/zipf/docs/make.bat.

Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

You should now populate your master file /Users/amira/zipf/docs/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. HTML, LaTeX or linkcheck.
```

`quickstart` creates a file called `conf.py` in the `docs` directory that configures Sphinx.
We will make two changes to that file
so that another tool called `autodoc` can find our modules (and their docstrings).
The first change relates to the "path setup" section near the head of the file:

```text
# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
```

Relative to the `docs/` directory,
our modules (i.e. `countwords.py`, `utilities.py`, etc) are located in the `../zipf` directory.
We therefore need to uncomment the relevant lines of the path setup section in `conf.py`
to tell Sphinx where those modules are:

```python
import os
import sys

sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../zipf'))
```

We will also change the "general configuration" section
to add `autodoc` to the list of Sphinx extensions we want:

```python
extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']
```

With those edits complete,
we can now generate a Sphinx `autodoc` script
that will read the docstrings from our package
and put them in `.rst` files in the `docs/source` directory:

```shell
sphinx-apidoc -o source/ ../zipf
```

```text
Creating file source/collate.rst.
Creating file source/countwords.rst.
Creating file source/plotcounts.rst.
Creating file source/test_zipfs.rst.
Creating file source/utilities.rst.
Creating file source/modules.rst.
```

We are finally ready to generate our webpage.
The `docs` sub-directory contains a Makefile that was generated by `sphinx-quickstart`.
If we run `make html` and open `docs/_build/index.html` in a web broswer
we'll have some minimal documentation in a familiar looking form (Figure \@ref(fig:packaging-sphinx-module-list)).
If we look under `modules` we will
see the documentation for the individual modules (Figure \@ref(fig:packaging-sphinx-module-countwords)).

```{r packaging-sphinx-module-list, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The module index"} <!-- at file:///Users/amira/zipf/docs/_build/html/py-modindex.html -->
knitr::include_graphics("figures/py-rse/packaging/module-index.png")
```

```{r packaging-sphinx-module-countwords, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The countwords documentation"} <!-- at `file:///Users/z3526123/Desktop/zipf/docs/_build/html/source/countwords.html#module-countwords -->
knitr::include_graphics("figures/py-rse/packaging/module-countwords.png")
```

The landing page for the website is the perfect place for the content of our README file,
so we can add the line `.. include:: ../README.rst` to the `docs/index.rst` file to insert it:

```text
Welcome to Zipf's documentation!
==================================

.. include:: ../README.rst

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

Indices and tables
==================

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`modindex`
* :ref:`search`
```

If we re-run `make html`,
we now get an updated set of web pages that
re-uses our README as the introduction to the documentation (Figure \@ref(fig:packaging-sphinx-landing-page)).

```{r packaging-sphinx-landing-page, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The landing page"} <!-- at `file:///Users/amira/zipf/docs/_build/html/index.html` -->
knitr::include_graphics("figures/py-rse/packaging/landing-page.png")
```

Before going on,
note that Sphinx is not included in the installation requirements in `requirements.txt` (Section \@ref(testing-ci)).
Sphinx isn't needed to run, develop, or even test our package,
but it is needed for building the documentation.
To note this requirement,
but without requiring everyone installing the package to install Sphinx,
let's create a `requirements_docs.txt` file that contains this line
(where the version number is found by running `pip freeze`):

```text
Sphinx>=1.7.4
```

Anyone wanting to build the documentation (including us, on another computer)
now only needs run `pip install -r requirement_docs.txt`

### Hosting Documentation Online {#packaging-rtd}

We can host the documentation for our project in several ways.
As mentioned above,
A very common option for Python projects is [Read The Docs][readthedocs],\index{Read The Docs (for Python documentation)}
a community-supported site that hosts software documentation free of charge.

Just as continuous integration systems automatically re-test things (Section \@ref(testing-ci)),
Read The Docs integrates with GitHub
so that documentation is automatically re-built
every time updates are pushed to the project's GitHub repository.\index{continuous integration!for documentation}
If we register for Read The Docs with our GitHub account,
we can import a project from our GitHub repository.
Read The Docs will then build the documentation using `make html`
and host the resulting files.

> FIXME: there was a note saying "We may need to add the line `master_doc = 'index'`
> to `docs/conf.py` if it isn't already there."
> This needs to be expanded.

For this to work,
all of the source files
need to be checked into your GitHub repository:
in our case,
this means `docs/source/*.rst`,
`docs/Makefile`,
`docs/conf.py`,
and `docs/index.rst`.
We also need to create and save a
[Read the Docs configuration file][readthedocs-config]
in the root directory of our `zipf` package:

```shell
$ pwd
```

```text
/Users/amira/zipf
```

```shell
$ cat .readthedocs.yml
```

```text
# .readthedocs.yml
# Read the Docs configuration file
# See https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html for details

# Required
version: 2

# Build documentation in the docs/ directory with Sphinx
sphinx:
  configuration: docs/conf.py

# Optionally set the version of Python and requirements required to build your docs
python:
  version: 3.7
  install:
    - requirements: requirements.txt
```

The configuration file uses the now-familiar [YAML][yaml] format\index{YAML}
(Section \@ref(config-formats) and Appendix \@ref(yaml))
to specify the location of the Sphinx configuration script (`docs/conf.py`)
and the dependencies for our package (`requirements.txt`).
If we named our project `zipf-docs`,
our documentation is now available at `https://zipf-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/`.

### Creating a FAQ {#project-faq}

As projects grow,
documentation within functions alone may be unsufficient for users to apply code to their own problems.
One strategy to assist other people with understanding a project is with
an [FAQ][faq]:\index{FAQ (Frequency Asked Questions)}\index{Python package!FAQ}
a list of frequently-asked questions and corresponding answers.
A good FAQ uses the terms and concepts that people bring to the software
rather than the vocabulary of its authors;
putting it another way,
the questions should be things that people might search for online,
and the answers should give them enough information to solve their problem.

Creating and maintaining a FAQ is a lot of work,
and unless the community is large and active,
a lot of that effort may turn out to be wasted,
because it's hard for the authors or maintainers of a piece of software
to anticipate what newcomers will be mystified by.
A better approach is to leverage sites like [Stack Overflow][stack-overflow],
which is where most programmers are going to look for answers anyway:

1.  Post every question that someone actually asks us,
    whether it's online, by email, or in person.
    Be sure to include the name of the software package in the question
    so that it's findable.

2.  Answer the question,
    making sure to mention which version of the software we're talking about
    (so that people can easily spot and discard stale answers in the future).

[Stack Overflow][stack-overflow]'s guide to [asking a good question][stack-overflow-good-question]
has been refined over many years,
and is a good guide for any project:

Write the most specific title we can.
:   "Why does division sometimes give a different result in Python 2.7 and Python 3.5?"
    is much better than, "Help! Math in Python!!"

Give context before giving sample code.
:   A few sentences to explain what are are trying to do and why
    will help people determine if their question is a close match to ours or not.

Provide a minimal reprex.
:   Section \@ref(teams-bugs) explains the value of a [reproducible example][reprex],
    and why reprexes should be as short as possible.
    Readers will have a much easier time figuring out if this question and its answers are for them
    if they can see *and understand* a few lines of code.

Tag, tag, tag.\index{tags (for documentation)}
:   Keywords make everything more findable,
    from scientific papers to left-handed musical instruments.

Use "I" and question words (how/what/when/where/why).
:   Writing this way forces us to think more clearly about
    what someone might actually be thinking when they need help.

Keep each item short.
:   The "minimal manual" approach to instructional design @Carr2014
    breaks everything down into single-page steps,
    with half of that page devoted to troubleshooting.
    This may feel trivializing to the person doing the writing,
    but is often as much as a person searching and reading can handle.
    It also helps writers realize just how much implicit knowledge they are assuming.

Allow for a [chorus of explanations][caulfield-chorus].
:   As discussed earlier,
    users are all different from one another,
    and are therefore best served by a chorus of explanations.
    Do not be afraid of providing multiple explanations to a single question
    that suggest different approaches
    or are written for different prior levels of understanding.

## Software Journals {#packaging-software-journals}

As a final step to releasing our new package,
we might want to give it a [DOI][doi]\index{DOI (Digital Object Identifier)}\index{Digital Object Identifier (DOI)}
so that it can be cited by researchers.
As we saw in Section \@ref(provenance-code-scripts),
GitHub [integrates with Zenodo][github-zenodo-tutorial]
for precisely this purpose.

While creating a DOI using a site like Zenodo
is often the end of the software publishing process,
there is the option of publishing
a journal paper to describe the software in detail.
Some research disciplines have journals devoted
to describing particular types of software
(e.g., [Geoscientific Model Development][geoscientific-model-development]),
and there are also a number of generic software journals such as the
[Journal of Open Research Software][jors] and
the [Journal of Open Source Software][theoj].
Packages submitted to these journals are typically assessed against a range of criteria
relating to how easy the software is to install
and how well it is documented,
so the peer review process can be a great way to get critical feedback
from people who have seen many research software packages come and go over the years.

Once you have obtained a DOI and possibly published with a software journal,
the last step is to tell users how to cite your new software package.
This is traditionally done by adding a `CITATION` file\index{CITATION file}\index{project files!CITATION}
to the associated GitHub repository
(alongside `README`, `LICENSE`, `CONDUCT` and similar files discussed in \@ref(intro-boilerplate)),
containing a plain text citation that can be copied and pasted into email
as well as entries formatted for various bibliographic systems like [BibTeX][bibtex].

```shell
$ cat CITATION.md
```

```text
# Citation

If you use the Zipf package for work/research presented in a publication,
we ask that you please cite:

Khan, A., and Virtanen, S., 2020. Zipf: A Python package for word count analysis.
*Journal of Important Software*, 5(51), 2317, https://doi.org/10.21105/jois.02317

### BibTeX entry

    }
```

## Summary {#packaging-summary}

Thousands of people have helped write the software that our Zipf's Law example relies on,
but their work is only useful because they packaged it
and documented how to use it.
Doing this is increasingly recognized as a credit-worthy activity
by universities, government labs, and other organizations,
particularly for research software engineers.
It is also deeply satisfying to make strangers' lives better,
if only in small ways.

## Exercises

### Fixing warnings {#packaging-ex-fixing-warnings}

When we ran `python setup.py sdist` in Section \@ref(packaging-distribute),
`setup.py` warned us about some missing metadata.
Review its output and then fix the problem.

### Separating requirements {#packaging-ex-separating-requirements}

As well as `requirements_docs.txt`,
developers often create a `requirements_dev.txt` file
to list packages that are not needed by the package's users,
but are required for its development and testing.
Pull `pytest` out of `requirements.txt` and put it in a new `requirements_dev.txt` file,
using `pip freeze` to find the minimum required version.

### Software review {#packaging-ex-software-review}

The [Journal of Open Source Software][theoj] has a
[checklist](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/review_checklist.html)
that reviewers must follow when assessing a submitted software paper.
Run through the checklist (skipping the criteria related to the software paper)
and see how the Zipf's Law package would rate on each criteria.

### Data packages {#packaging-ex-data}

R provides many [data packages][data_package]
that can be loaded like any other library but provide a dataset instead of
(or as well as)
runnable code.
Create a Python package called `collated` that provides a single function `getData`,
so that:

```python
import collated
counts = collated.getData()
```

assigns a dictionary of word frequencies to the variable `counts`
using the data from the Zipf project's `collated.csv`.
Do *not* copy the data into a Python file;
instead,
have `getData` read the data from a copy of the CSV file distributed as part of the package.
(Hint: the special variable `collated.__path__`
holds the directory containing the installed `collated` package.)

### Staying up to date {#packaging-ex-up-to-date}

1.  Run `pip list` to get a list of the Python packages you have installed.
    How many are there?

2.  Run `pip list -o` to get a list of packages that are out of date.
    (This may take a few seconds.)
    How many are there,
    and how can you update them?
