The more software we write,
the more we come to think of programming languages as a way to build and combine libraries.
Every widely-used language now has an online repository
from which people can download and install those libraries.
This lesson shows you how to use Python's tools to create and share libraries of your own.

We will continue with our Zipf's Law project,
which should include the following files:

## Creating a Python Package {#packaging-package}

A package consists of one or more Python source files\index{Python package!structure}
in a specific directory structure
combined with installation instructions for the computer.
Python packages can come from various sources:
some are distributed with Python itself,
but anyone can create one,
and there are thousands that can be downloaded and installed from online repositories.

> **Terminology**
>
> People sometimes refer to packages as modules.\index{Python package vs.\ module}
> Strictly speaking,
> a module is a single source file,
> while a package is a directory structure that contains one or more modules.

A generic package folder hierarchy looks like this:

```text
pkg_name
├── pkg_name
│   ├── module1.py
│   └── module2.py
├── README.md
└── setup.py
```

The top-level directory is named after the package.
It contains a directory that is also named after the package,
and that contains the package's source files.
It is initially a little confusing to have two directories with the same name,
but most Python projects follow this convention because
it makes it easier to set up the project for installation.
We can get this structure in our Zipf's Law project
by renaming `zipf/bin` to `zipf`.

> **`__init__.py`**
>
> Python packages often contain a file with a special name:
> `__init__.py`\index{\_\_init\_\_.py file (in Python package)}\index{Python package!\_\_init\_\_.py file}
> (two underscores before and after `init`).
> Just as importing a module file executes the code in the module,
> importing a package executes the code in `__init__.py`.
> Packages *had* to have this file before Python 3.3,
> even if it was empty,
> but since Python 3.3 it is only needed
> if we want to run some code as the package is being imported.

To make the Zipf's Law project work as a Python package,
we only need to make one important change to the code itself:
changing the syntax for how we import our own modules.
Currently,
both `collate.py` and `countwords.py` contains this line,

```python
import utilities as util
```

while `test_zipfs.py` contains:

```python
import plotcounts
import countwords
```

These are called
\gref{implicit relative imports}{implicit_relative_import},\index{Python!import!implicit relative}\index{implicit relative import (in Python)}
because it is not clear whether we mean
"import a Python package called `utilities`"
or
"import a file in our local directory called `utilities.py`"
(which is what we want).
To remove this ambiguity we need to be explicit and write,

```python
from zipf import utilities as util
```
and

```python
from zipf import plotcounts
from zipf import countwords
```

These are \gref{absolute imports}{absolute_import}\index{Python!import!absolute}\index{absolute import (in Python)}
since we are specifying the full location of `utilities`, `plotcounts` and `countwords`
inside the `zipf` package.
Absolute imports are the preferred way for parts of a package to import other parts,
but we can also use
\gref{explicit relative imports}{explicit_relative_import},\index{Python!import!explicit relative}\index{explicit relative import (in Python)}
which require a little less typing
and can sometimes make it easier to restructure very large projects:

```python
from . import utilities as util
```

Here,
the `.` signals that `utilities` exists in the current directory.

Python has several ways to build an installable package.\index{Python package!building}
We will show how to use [setuptools][setuptools],\index{setuptools (in Python)}\index{Python!setuptools}
which is the lowest common denominator
and will allow everyone,
regardless of what Python distribution they have,
to use our package.
To use `setuptools`,
we must create a file called `setup.py` in the directory *above* the root directory of the package.
(This is why we require the two-level directory structure described earlier.)
`setup.py` must have exactly that name,
and must contain lines like these:

```python
from setuptools import setup


setup(
    name='zipf',
    version='0.1.0',
    author='Amira Khan',
    packages=['zipf'])
```

The `name` and `author` parameters are self-explanatory.
Most software projects use \gref{semantic versioning}{semantic_versioning}\index{semantic versioning}\index{Python package!semantic versioning}
for software releases.
A version number consists of three integers X.Y.Z,
where X is the major version,\index{software version number}
Y is the minor version,
and Z is the \gref{patch}{patch} version.\index{patch (of software version)}
Major version zero (0.Y.Z) is for initial development, so we have started with 0.1.0.
The first stable public release would be version 1.0.0,
and in general, the version number is incremented as follows:

-   Increment `major` every time there's an incompatible externally-visible change
-   Increment `minor` when adding new functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
    (i.e. without breaking any existing code)
-   Increment `patch` for backwards-compatible bug fixes that don't add any new features

Finally,
we specify the name of the directory
containing the code to be packaged with the `packages` parameter.
This is straightforward in our case because we only have a single package directory.
For more complex projects,
the [`find_packages`][find-packages] function from `setuptools`
can automatically find all packages by recursively searching the current directory.

## Virtual Environments {#packaging-virtualenv}

We can add additional information to our package later,
but this is enough to be able to build it for testing purposes.
Before we do that,
though,
we should create a \gref{virtual environment}{virtual_environment}\index{virtual environment (in Python)}\index{Python!virtual environment}
to test how our package installs
without breaking anything in our main Python installation.

A virtual environment is a layer on top of an existing Python installation.
Whenever Python needs to find a package,
it looks in the virtual environment before checking the main Python installation.
This gives us a place to install packages that only some projects need
without affecting other projects.

Virtual environments also help with package development:

-   We want to be able to easily test install and uninstall our package,
    without affecting the entire Python environment.
-   We want to answer problems people have with our package with something more helpful than
    "I don't know, it works for me".
    By installing and running our package in a completely empty environment,
    we can ensure that we're not accidentally relying on other packages being installed.

We can manage virtual environments using [conda][conda] (Appendix \@ref(anaconda)).
To create a new virtual environment called `zipf` we run `conda create`,\index{virtual environment (in Python)!creating}
specifying the environment's name with the `-n` or `--name` flag
and listing `python` as the base to build on:

```bash
$ conda create -n zipf python
```

```text
Collecting package metadata (current_repodata.json): done
Solving environment: done

## Package Plan ##

  environment location: /home/amira/anaconda3/envs/zipf

...

Executing transaction: done
#
# To activate this environment, use
#
#     $ conda activate zipf
#
# To deactivate an active environment, use
#
#     $ conda deactivate
```

`conda` creates the directory `~/anaconda3/envs/zipf`,
which contains the subdirectories needed for a minimal Python installation,
such as `bin` and `lib`.
It also creates `~/anaconda3/envs/zipf/bin/python`,
which checks for packages in these directories before checking the main installation.

We can switch to the `zipf` environment by running:\index{virtual environment (in Python)!switching}

```bash
$ conda activate zipf
```

Once we have done this,
the `python` command runs the interpreter in `zipf/bin`:

```bash
(zipf)$ which python
```

```text
/home/amira/anaconda3/envs/zipf/bin/python
```

Notice that every shell command displays `(zipf)` when that virtual environment is active.
Between Git branches and virtual environments,
it can be very easy to lose track of what exactly we are working on and with.
Prompts like this can make it a little less confusing;
using virtual environment names that match the names of your projects
(and branches, if you're testing different environments on different branches)
quickly becomes essential.

We can now install packages safely.
Everything we install will go into `zipf` virtual environment
without affecting the underlying Python installation.
When we are done,
we can switch back to the default environment using `conda deactivate`:

```bash
(zipf)$ conda deactivate

```
```bash
$ which python
```

```text
/usr/bin/python
```

## Installing a Development Package {#packaging-installing}

Let's install our package in this virtual environment.\index{Python package!installation}
First we re-activate it:

```bash
$ conda activate zipf
```

Next,
we go into the upper `zipf` directory that contains our `setup.py` file
and install our package using `pip install -e .`.
The `-e` option indicates that we want to to install the package in "editable" mode,
which means that any changes we make in the package code are directly available to use
without having to reinstall the package;
the `.` means "install from the current directory":

```text
(zipf)$ cd zipf
(zipf)$ pip install -e .
```

```text
Processing /home/amira/proj/py-rse/zipf/zipf

  Stored in directory: /tmp/pip-ephem-wheel/wheels/a8/a6/0e/8b2a5cb
Successfully built zipf
Installing collected packages: zipf
Successfully installed zipf-0.1.0
```

If we look in `~/anaconda3/envs/zipf/lib/python3.8/site-packages/`,
we can see the `zipf` package beside all the other locally-installed packages.
If we try to use the package at this stage,
though,
Python will complain that some of the packages it depends on,
such as `pandas`,
are not installed.
We could install these manually,
but it is more reliable to automate this process
by listing everything that our package depends on
using the `install_requires` parameter in `setup.py`:

```python
from setuptools import setup


setup(
    name='zipf',
    version='0.1',
    author='Amira Khan',
    packages=['zipf'],
    install_requires=[
        'matplotlib',
        'pandas',
        'scipy',
        'pyyaml',
        'pytest'])
```

We don't have to list `numpy` explicitly
because it will be installed as a dependency for `pandas` and `scipy`.\index{dependency!package}

> **Versioning Dependencies**
>
> It is good practice to specify the versions of our dependencies
> and even better to specify version ranges.
> For example, if we have only tested our package on pandas version 1.0.1,
> we could put `pandas==1.0.1` or `pandas>=1.0.1` instead of just `pandas`
> in the list argument passed to the `install_requires` parameter.

We can now install our package and all its dependencies in a single command:

```bash
(zipf)$ pip install -e .
```

```

(The precise output of this command will change
depending on which versions of our dependencies get installed.)

We can now import our package in a script or a [Jupyter notebook][jupyter]
just as we would any other package.
For example,
to use the function in `utilities`,
we would write:

```python
from zipf import utilities


utilities.collection_to_csv(...)
```

However,
the useful command-line scripts that we used to count and plot word counts
are no longer accessible directly from the terminal.
Fortunately,
the `setuptools` package allows us to install programs along with the package.\index{Python package!installing programs}
These programs are placed beside those of other packages.
We tell `setuptools` to do this by defining
\gref{entry points}{entry_point}:\index{entry point (in Python package)}\index{Python package!entry point}

```python
from setuptools import setup


setup(
    name='zipf',
    version='0.1',
    author='Amira Khan',
    packages=['zipf'],
    install_requires=[
        'matplotlib',
        'pandas',
        'scipy',
        'pyyaml',
        'pytest'],
    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': [
            'countwords = zipf.countwords:main',
            'collate = zipf.collate:main',
            'plotcounts = zipf.plotcounts:main']})
```

The right side of the `=` operator is the location of a function,
written as `package.module:function`;
the left side is the name we want to use to call this function from the command line.
In this case we want to call each module's `main`,
which as it stands requires an input argument `args`
containing the command-line arguments given by the user (Section \@ref(scripting-options)).
For example,
the relevant section of our `countwords.py` program is:

```python
def main(args):
    """Run the command line program."""
    with args.infile as reader:
        word_counts = count_words(reader)
    util.collection_to_csv(word_counts, num=args.num)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=__doc__)
    parser.add_argument('infile', type=argparse.FileType('r'),
                        nargs='?', default='-',
                        help='Input file name')
    parser.add_argument('-n', '--num',
                        type=int, default=None,
                        help='Output only n most frequent words')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    main(args)
```

We can't pass any arguments to `main` when we define entry points in our `setup.py` file,
so we need to change this slightly:

```python
def parse_command_line():
    """Parse the command line for input arguments."""
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=__doc__)
    parser.add_argument('infile', type=argparse.FileType('r'),
                        nargs='?', default='-',
                        help='Input file name')
    parser.add_argument('-n', '--num',
                        type=int, default=None,
                        help='Output only n most frequent words')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    return args


def main():
    """Run the command line program."""
    args = parse_command_line()
    with args.infile as reader:
        word_counts = count_words(reader)
    util.collection_to_csv(word_counts, num=args.num)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Once we have made the corresponding change in `collate.py` and `plotcounts.py`,
we can re-install our package:

```bash
(zipf)$ pip install -e .
```

The output looks slightly different than the first run
because `pip` could re-use some packages saved locally by the previous install
rather than re-fetching them from online repositories.
(If we hadn't used the `-e` option to make the package immediately editable,
we would have to uninstall it before reinstalling it during development.)

We can now use our commands directly from the terminal
without writing the full path to the file
and without prefixing it with `python`.

## What Installation Does {#packaging-installation}

Now that we have created and installed a Python package,
let's explore what actually happens during installation.\index{Python package!installation}
The short version is that
the contents of the package are copied into a directory that Python will search
when it imports things.
In theory we can "install" packages by manually copying source code into the right places,
but it's much more efficient and safer to use a tool specifically made for this purpose,
such as `conda` or `pip`.

Most of the time,
these tools copy packages into the Python installation's `site-packages` directory,\index{Python!site-packages directory}
but this is not the only place Python searches.
Just as the `PATH` environment in the shell contains a list of directories
that the shell searches for programs it can execute (Section \@ref(bash-advanced-vars)),
the Python variable `sys.path` contains a list of the directories it searches.
We can look at this list inside the interpreter:

```python
import sys
sys.path
```

```
['',
'/home/amira/anaconda3/envs/zipf/lib/python37.zip',
'/home/amira/anaconda3/envs/zipf/lib/python3.7',
'/home/amira/anaconda3/envs/zipf/lib/python3.7/lib-dynload',
'/home/amira/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages',
'/home/amira/anaconda3/envs/zipf/lib/python3.7/site-packages',
'/home/amira/zipf']
```

The empty string at the start of the list means "the current directory".
The rest are system paths for our Python installation,
and will vary from computer to computer.

## Distributing Packages {#packaging-distribute}

An installable package is most useful
if we distribute it so that anyone who wants it
can run `pip install zipf`\index{Python package!distribution}
and get it.
To make this possible,
we need to use `setuptools` to create
a \gref{source distribution}{source_distribution}\index{source distribution (of Python package)}\index{Python package!source distribution}
(known as an `sdist` in Python packaging jargon):

```bash
$ python setup.py sdist
```

```text

These distribution files can now be distributed via [PyPI][pypi],
the standard repository for Python packages.
Before doing that,
though,
we can put `zipf` on [TestPyPI][testpypi],
which lets us test distribution of our package\index{Python package!testing distribution}
without having things appear in the main PyPI repository.
We must have an account,
but they are free to create.

The preferred tool for uploading packages to PyPI is called [twine][twine],
which we can install with:

```bash
$ pip install twine
```

Following the [Python Packaging User Guide][pypi-user-guide],
we can now upload our distributions from the `dist/` folder
using the `--repository` option to specify the TestPyPI repository:

```bash
$ twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

```

We have now uploaded both types of distribution,
allowing people to use the wheel distribution if their system supports it
or the source distribution if it does not.
We can test that this has worked
by creating a virtual environment
and installing our package from TestPyPI:

```bash
$ conda create -n zipf-test
$ conda activate zipf-test
(zipf-test)$ pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple zipf
```

Once again,
`pip` takes advantage of the fact that some packages already existing on our system
and doesn't download them again.
Once we are happy with how our package appears in TestPyPI
(including its [project page][zipf-project-page]),\index{Python package!project page}\index{project page (of Python package)}
we can go through the same process to put it on the main [PyPI][pypi] repository.

## Documenting Packages {#packaging-document}

Now that our package has been distributed,
we need to think about whether we have provided sufficient documentation.
Docstrings (Section \@ref(scripting-docstrings)) and READMEs
are sufficient to describe most simple packages,
but as our code base grows larger
we will want to complement these manually written sections with automatically generated content,
references between functions,
and search functionality.
For most large Python packages,
such documentation is generated using a \gref{documentation generator}{documentation_generator}
called [Sphinx][sphinx],\index{Python package!documentation!Sphinx}
which is often used in combination with a free online hosting service called
[Read The Docs][readthedocs]\index{Read The Docs (for Python documentation)}.
In this section we will update our README file with some basic package-level documentation,
before using Sphinx and Read The Docs to host that information online
along with more detailed function-level documentation.
For further advice on writing documentation for larger and more complex packages,
see Appendix \@ref(documentation).

### Including package-level documentation in the `README` {#packaging-readme}

When a user first encounters a package,\index{Python package!documentation}
they usually want to know what the package is meant to do,
instructions on how to install it,
and examples of how to use it.
We can include these elements in the `README.md` file we started in Chapter \@ref(git-advanced).
At the moment it reads as follows:

```bash
$ cat README.md
```

```text
# Zipf's Law

These Zipf's Law scripts tally the occurrences of words in text
files and plot each word's rank versus its frequency.

## Contributors

- Amira Khan <amira@zipf.org>
- Sami Virtanen <sami@zipf.org>
```

This file is currently written in [Markdown][markdown]\index{Markdown},
but Sphinx uses a format called \gref{reStructuredText}{restructured_text} (reST),\index{reST (reStructured Text)}\index{reStructured Text (reST)}
so we will switch to that.
Like Markdown,
reST is a plain-text markup format
that can be rendered into HTML or PDF documents
with complex indices and cross-links.
GitHub recognizes files ending in `.rst` as reST files and displays them nicely,
so our first task is to rename our existing file:

```bash
$ git mv README.md README.rst
```

We then make a few edits to the file:
titles are underlined and overlined,
section headings are underlined,
and code blocks are set off with two colons (`::`) and indented:

```markdown
The ``zipf`` package tallies the occurrences of words in text files
and plots each word's rank versus its frequency
together with a line for the theoretical distribution for Zipf's Law.

Motivation
----------

Zipf's Law is often stated as an observational pattern seen in the
relationship between the frequency and rank of words in a text:

`"…the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often
as the second most frequent word,
three times as often as the third most
frequent word, etc."`
— `wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law>`_

Many books are available to download in plain text format
from sites such as `Project Gutenberg <https://www.gutenberg.org/>`_,
so we created this package to qualitatively explore how well
different books align with the word frequencies predicted by
Zipf's Law.

Installation
------------

``pip install zipf``

Usage
-----

After installing this package, the following three commands will
be available from the command line

- ``countwords`` for counting the occurrences of words in a text.
- ``collate`` for collating multiple word count files together.
- ``plotcounts`` for visualizing the word counts.

A typical usage scenario would include running the following from
your terminal::

    countwords dracula.txt > dracula.csv
    countwords moby_dick.txt > moby_dick.csv
    collate dracula.csv moby_dick.csv > collated.csv
    plotcounts collated.csv --outfile zipf-drac-moby.jpg

Additional information on each function
can be found in their docstrings and appending the ``-h`` flag,
e.g. ``countwords -h``.

### Creating a web page for documentation {#packaging-sphinx}

Now that we've added package-level documentation to our README file,
we need to think about function-level documentation.
We want to provide users with a list of all the functions available in our package
along with a short description of what they do and how to use them.
We could achieve this by manually cutting and pasting function names and docstrings
from our Python modules (i.e. `countwords.py`, `plotcounts.py`, etc),
but that would be a time consuming process prone to errors as more functions are added over time.
Instead, we can use a \gref{documentation generator}{documentation_generator}
called [Sphinx][sphinx]\index{Python package!documentation!Sphinx}
that is capable of scanning Python code for function names and docstrings
and can export that information to HTML format for hosting on the web.

To start, let's install Sphinx and create a `docs/` directory at the top of our repository:

```bash
$ pip install sphinx
$ mkdir docs
$ cd docs
```

We can then run Sphinx's `quickstart` tool to create a minimal set of documentation
that includes the package-level information in the `README.rst` file we just created
and the function-level information in the docstrings we've written along the way.
It asks us to specify the project's name,
the name of the project's author,
and a release;
we can use the default settings for everything else.

```bash
$ sphinx-quickstart
```

```text
Welcome to the Sphinx 3.1.1 quickstart utility.

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter
to accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

Selected root path: .

You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx
output. Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root
path, or you separate "source" and "build" directories within the
root path.
> Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]: n

The project name will occur in several places in the built
documentation.
> Project name: zipf
> Author name(s): Amira Khan
> Project release []: 0.1

If the documents are to be written in a language other than
English, you can select a language here by its language code.
Sphinx will then translate text that it generates into that
language.

For a list of supported codes, see
https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html
> Project language [en]:

Creating file /Users/amira/zipf/docs/conf.py.
Creating file /Users/amira/zipf/docs/index.rst.
Creating file /Users/amira/zipf/docs/Makefile.
Creating file /Users/amira/zipf/docs/make.bat.

Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

You should now populate your master file
/Users/amira/zipf/docs/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. HTML,
LaTeX or linkcheck.
```

`quickstart` creates a file called `conf.py` in the `docs` directory that configures Sphinx.
We will make two changes to that file
so that another tool called `autodoc` can find our modules (and their docstrings).
The first change relates to the "path setup" section near the head of the file:

```text
# -- Path setup -------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in
# another directory, add these directories to sys.path here. If the
# directory is relative to the documentation root, use
# os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
```

Relative to the `docs/` directory,
our modules (i.e. `countwords.py`, `utilities.py`, etc) are located in the `../zipf` directory.
We therefore need to uncomment the relevant lines of the path setup section in `conf.py`
to tell Sphinx where those modules are:

```python
import os
import sys

sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../zipf'))
```

We will also change the "general configuration" section
to add `autodoc` to the list of Sphinx extensions we want:

```python
extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']
```

With those edits complete,
we can now generate a Sphinx `autodoc` script
that generates information about each of our modules
and puts it in corresponding `.rst` files in the `docs/source` directory:

```bash
sphinx-apidoc -o source/ ../zipf
```

```text
Creating file source/collate.rst.
Creating file source/countwords.rst.
Creating file source/plotcounts.rst.
Creating file source/test_zipfs.rst.
Creating file source/utilities.rst.
Creating file source/modules.rst.
```

At this point, we are ready to generate our webpage.
The `docs` sub-directory contains a Makefile that was generated by `sphinx-quickstart`.
If we run `make html` and open `docs/_build/index.html` in a web browser
we'll have a website landing page with minimal documentation (Figure \@ref(fig:packaging-sphinx-landing-page-original)).
If we click on the `Module Index` link we can access the documentation for the individual modules
(Figures \@ref(fig:packaging-sphinx-module-list) and \@ref(fig:packaging-sphinx-module-countwords)).

```{r packaging-sphinx-landing-page-original, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The default website landing page."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/packaging/landing-page-original.png")
```

```{r packaging-sphinx-module-list, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The module index."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/packaging/module-index.png")
```

```{r packaging-sphinx-module-countwords, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The countwords documentation."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/packaging/module-countwords.png")
```

The landing page for the website is the perfect place for the content of our README file,
so we can add the line `.. include:: ../README.rst` to the `docs/index.rst` file to insert it:

```markdown
Welcome to Zipf's documentation!
==================================

.. include:: ../README.rst

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

Indices and tables
==================

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`modindex`
* :ref:`search`
```

If we re-run `make html`,
we now get an updated set of web pages that
re-uses our README as the introduction to the documentation (Figure \@ref(fig:packaging-sphinx-landing-page)).

```{r packaging-sphinx-landing-page, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The new landing page showing the contents of README.rst."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/packaging/landing-page.png")
```

Before going on,
note that Sphinx is not included in the installation requirements in `requirements.txt` (Section \@ref(testing-ci)).
Sphinx isn't needed to run, develop, or even test our package,
but it is needed for building the documentation.
To note this requirement,
but without requiring everyone installing the package to install Sphinx,
let's create a `requirements_docs.txt` file that contains this line
(where the version number is found by running `pip freeze`):

```text
Sphinx>=1.7.4
```

Anyone wanting to build the documentation (including us, on another computer)
now only needs run `pip install -r requirement_docs.txt`

### Hosting documentation online {#packaging-rtd}

Now that we have generated our package documentation,
we need to host it online.
A common option for Python projects is [Read The Docs][readthedocs],\index{Read The Docs (for Python documentation)}
which is a community-supported site that hosts software documentation free of charge.

Just as continuous integration systems automatically re-test things (Section \@ref(testing-ci)),
Read The Docs integrates with GitHub
so that documentation is automatically re-built
every time updates are pushed to the project's GitHub repository.\index{continuous integration!for documentation}
If we register for Read The Docs with our GitHub account,
we can import a project from our GitHub repository.
Read The Docs will then build the documentation
(using `make html` just as we did earlier)
and host the resulting files.

For this to work,
all of the source files
need to be checked into your GitHub repository:
in our case,
this means `docs/source/*.rst`,
`docs/Makefile`,
`docs/conf.py`,
and `docs/index.rst`.
We also need to create and save a
[Read the Docs configuration file][readthedocs-config]
in the root directory of our `zipf` package:

```bash
$ pwd
```

```text
/Users/amira/zipf
```

```bash
$ cat .readthedocs.yml
```

```text
# .readthedocs.yml
# Read the Docs configuration file
# See https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html
# for details

# Required
version: 2

# Build documentation in the docs/ directory with Sphinx
sphinx:
  configuration: docs/conf.py

# Optionally set the version of Python and requirements required
# to build your docs
python:
  version: 3.7
  install:
    - requirements: requirements.txt
```

The configuration file uses the now-familiar \gref{YAML}{yaml} format\index{YAML}
(Section \@ref(config-formats) and Appendix \@ref(yaml))
to specify the location of the Sphinx configuration script (`docs/conf.py`)
and the dependencies for our package (`requirements.txt`).
If we named our project `zipf-docs`,
our documentation is now available at `https://zipf-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/`.

## Software Journals {#packaging-software-journals}

As a final step to releasing our new package,
we might want to give it a \gref{DOI}{doi}\index{DOI (Digital Object Identifier)}\index{Digital Object Identifier (DOI)}
so that it can be cited by researchers.
As we saw in Section \@ref(provenance-code-scripts),
GitHub [integrates with Zenodo][github-zenodo-tutorial]
for precisely this purpose.

While creating a DOI using a site like Zenodo
is often the end of the software publishing process,
there is the option of publishing
a journal paper to describe the software in detail.
Some research disciplines have journals devoted
to describing particular types of software
(e.g., [Geoscientific Model Development][geoscientific-model-development]),
and there are also a number of generic software journals such as the
[Journal of Open Research Software][jors] and
the [Journal of Open Source Software][theoj].
Packages submitted to these journals are typically assessed against a range of criteria
relating to how easy the software is to install
and how well it is documented,
so the peer review process can be a great way to get critical feedback
from people who have seen many research software packages come and go over the years.

Once you have obtained a DOI and possibly published with a software journal,
the last step is to tell users how to cite your new software package.
This is traditionally done by adding a `CITATION` file\index{CITATION file}\index{project files!CITATION}
to the associated GitHub repository
(alongside `README`, `LICENSE`, `CONDUCT` and similar files discussed in Section \@ref(getting-started-boilerplate)),
containing a plain text citation that can be copied and pasted into email
as well as entries formatted for various bibliographic systems like [BibTeX][bibtex].

```bash
$ cat CITATION.md
```

```text
# Citation

If you use the Zipf package for work/research presented in a
publication, we ask that you please cite:

Khan, A., and Virtanen, S., 2020. Zipf: A Python package for word
count analysis. *Journal of Important Software*, 5(51), 2317,
https://doi.org/10.21105/jois.02317

```

## Summary {#packaging-summary}

Thousands of people have helped write the software that our Zipf's Law example relies on,
but their work is only useful because they packaged it
and documented how to use it.
Doing this is increasingly recognized as a credit-worthy activity
by universities, government labs, and other organizations,
particularly for research software engineers.
It is also deeply satisfying to make strangers' lives better,
if only in small ways.

## Exercises

### Fixing warnings {#packaging-ex-fixing-warnings}

When we ran `python setup.py sdist` in Section \@ref(packaging-distribute),
`setup.py` warned us about some missing metadata.
Review its output and then fix the problem.

### Separating requirements {#packaging-ex-separating-requirements}

As well as `requirements_docs.txt`,
developers often create a `requirements_dev.txt` file
to list packages that are not needed by the package's users,
but are required for its development and testing.
Pull `pytest` out of `requirements.txt` and put it in a new `requirements_dev.txt` file,
using `pip freeze` to find the minimum required version.

### Software review {#packaging-ex-software-review}

The [Journal of Open Source Software][theoj] has a [checklist][theoj-checklist]
that reviewers must follow when assessing a submitted software paper.
Run through the checklist (skipping the criteria related to the software paper)
and see how the Zipf's Law package would rate on each criteria.

### Staying up to date {#packaging-ex-up-to-date}

1.  Run `pip list` to get a list of the Python packages you have installed.
    How many are there?

2.  Run `pip list -o` to get a list of packages that are out of date.
    (This may take a few seconds.)
    How many are there,
    and how can you update them?

### Packaging quotations {#packaging-ex-pratchett}

Each chapter in this book opens with a quote from the British author Terry Pratchett.
This script `quotes.py` contains a function `random_quote` which prints a random Pratchett quote:

```python
import random


quote_list = ["It's still magic even if you know how it's done.",
              "Everything starts somewhere, "\
              "though many physicists disagree.",
              "Ninety percent of most magic merely consists "\
              "of knowing one extra fact.",
              "Wisdom comes from experience. "\
              "Experience is often a result of lack of wisdom.",
              "There isn't a way things should be. "\
              "There's just what happens, and what we do.",
              "Multiple exclamation marks are a sure sign "\
              "of a diseased mind.",
              "+++ Divide By Cucumber Error. "\
              "Please Reinstall Universe And Reboot +++",
              "It's got three keyboards and a hundred extra "\
              "knobs, including twelve with ‘?' on them.",
             ]


def random_quote():
    """Print a random Pratchett quote."""
    print(random.choice(quote_list))
```

Create a new conda development environment called `pratchett`
and use `pip` to install a new package called `pratchett` into that environment.
The package should contain `quotes.py`,
and once the package has been installed the user should be able to run:

```python
from pratchett import quotes


quotes.random_quote()
```

## Key Points {#packaging-keypoints}

```{r, child="keypoints/packaging.md"}
```
