- Testing can only ever show that software has flaws, not that it is correct.
- The real purpose is to convince people (including yourself) that software is
correct enough, and to make tolerances on 'enough' explicit.
- A testing suite finds and runs tests written in a prescribed fashion and reports
their results.
- A unit test can pass (work as expected), fail (meaning the software under test
is flawed), or produce an error (meaning the test itself is flawed).
- Every unit test should be independent of each other so results are
comprehensible, contained, and reliable.
- Tests should be built to test that the software fails when and as it is supposed.
