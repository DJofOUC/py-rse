-   A [build manager][build_manager] re-runs commands so all files and their dependencies are up-to-date with each other.
-   [Make][make] is a widely-used build manager.
-   A Make [build rule][build_rule] has [targets][build_target], [prerequisites][prerequisite], and [recipes][build_recipe].
-   A target can correspond to a file or be a [phony target][phony_target] (used simply to trigger actions).
-   When a target is out of date with respect to its prerequisites, Make executes the recipes associated with its rule.
-   Make executes as many rules as it needs to when updating files, but always respects prerequisite order.
-   Make defines the [automatic variables][automatic_variable] `$@` (target), `$^` (all prerequisites), and `$<` (first prerequisite).
-   [Pattern rules][pattern_rule] can use `%` as a placeholder for parts of filenames.
-   Makefiles can define variables using `NAME=value`.
-   Makefiles can also use functions such as `$(wildcard ...)` and `$(patsubst ...)`.
-   Specially-formatted comments can be used to make Makefiles self-documenting.
