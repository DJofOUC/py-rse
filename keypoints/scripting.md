-   Turn your Python code into a standalone program (a "Python [script][script]")
    that can be run in the Unix shell just like other command-line tools.
-   Most Python scripts have a similar structure that can be used as a template.
-   Libraries such as [argparse][argparse] can be used to efficiently handle command line arguments.
-   Use [docstrings][docstring] to document functions and scripts.
-   Functions used across multiple scripts should be placed
    in a separate file that can be imported as a module.
