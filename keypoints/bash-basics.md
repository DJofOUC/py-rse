-   The [filesystem][filesystem] manages information stored on disk.
-   Information is stored in files, which are located in directories (folders).
-   Directories can also store other directories, which forms a directory tree.

-   `/` on its own is the [root directory][root_directory] of the whole filesystem.
-   `ls` prints a list of files and directories.
-   An [absolute path][absolute_path] specifies a location from the root of the filesystem.
-   A [relative path][relative_path] specifies a location in the filesystem starting from the current directory.
-   `cd` changes the current working directory.
-   `..` means the [parent directory][parent_directory]; `.` on its own means the current directory.

    and a [body][loop_body] containing commands to execute.
-   Use `$name` or `${name}` to get the value of a variable.
