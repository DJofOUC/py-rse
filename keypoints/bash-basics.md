-   A \gref{shell}{shell} is a program that reads commands and runs other programs.
-   The \gref{filesystem}{filesystem} manages information stored on disk.
-   Information is stored in files, which are located in directories (folders).
-   Directories can also store other directories, which forms a directory tree.
-   `pwd` prints the user's \gref{current working directory}{current_working_directory}.
-   `/` on its own is the \gref{root directory}{root_directory} of the whole filesystem.
-   `ls` prints a list of files and directories.
-   An \gref{absolute path}{absolute_path} specifies a location from the root of the filesystem.
-   A \gref{relative path}{relative_path} specifies a location in the filesystem starting from the current directory.
-   `cd` changes the current working directory.
-   `..` means the \gref{parent directory}{parent_directory}; `.` on its own means the current directory.
-   `mkdir` creates a new directory.
-   `cp` copies a file.
-   `rm` removes (deletes) a file.
-   `mv` moves (renames) a file or directory.
-   `*` matches zero or more characters in a filename.
-   `?` matches any single character in a filename.
-   `wc` counts lines, words, and characters in its inputs.
-   `man` displays the manual page for a given command; some commands also have a `--help` option.
-   Every process in Unix has an input channel called \gref{standard input}{stdin}
    and an output channel called \gref{standard output}{stdin}.
-   `>` redirects a command's output to a file, overwriting any existing content.
-   `>>` appends a command's output to a file.
-   `<` operator redirects input to a command
-   A \gref{pipe}{pipe_shell} `|` sends the output of the command on the left to the input of the command on the right.
-   `cat` displays the contents of its inputs.
-   `head` displays the first few lines of its input.
-   `tail` displays the last few lines of its input.
-   `sort` sorts its inputs.
-   A `for` loop repeats commands once for every thing in a list.
-   Every `for` loop  must have a variable to refer to the thing it is currently operating on
    and a \gref{body}{loop_body} containing commands to execute.
-   Use `$name` or `${name}` to get the value of a variable.
-   Use the up-arrow key to scroll up through previous commands to edit and repeat them.
-   Use \gref{`history`}{command_history} to display recent commands and `!number` to repeat a command by number.
