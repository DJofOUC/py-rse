-   [Branches][git_branch] allow new features to be developed while leaving the master branch untouched.
-   `git branch` creates a new branch. 
-   `git checkout` switches between branches.
-   `git merge` [merges][git_merge] a nominated branch into the current branch.
-   [Conflicts][git_conflict] occur when two or more people change the same lines of the same file.
-   The version control system does not allow people to overwrite each otherâ€™s changes blindly,
    but highlights conflicts so that they can be resolved.
-   Use a [branch-per-feature][branch_per_feature] workflow.
-   [Fork][git_fork] a repository that you would like to make changes to (if you don't have write access).
-   `git clone` copies a remote repository to create a local repository.
-   Create a new remote called `upstream` to point at the repository a fork was derived from.
-   Create a [pull request][pull_request] to ask that the changes in your fork
    be merged into the upstream repository.
