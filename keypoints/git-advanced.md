-   Use a [branch-per-feature][branch_per_feature] workflow to develop new features while leaving the master branch in working order.
-   `git branch` creates a new branch. 
-   `git checkout` switches between branches.
-   `git merge` [merges][git_merge] changes from another branch into the current branch.
-   [Conflicts][git_conflict] occur when files or parts of files are changed in different ways on different branches.
-   Version control systems do not allow people to overwrite changes silently;
    instead, they highlight conflicts that need to be resolved.
-   [Forking][git_fork] a repository makes a copy of it on a server.
-   [Cloning][git_clone] a repository with `git clone` creates a local copy of a remote repository.
-   Create a remote called `upstream` to point to the repository a fork was derived from.
-   Create [pull requests][pull_request] to submit changes from your fork to the upstream repository.
