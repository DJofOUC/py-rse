    each of which overrides the layers above it.

-   Use a user-specific configuration file for personal preferences (layer 2).
-   Use a job-specific configuration file with settings for a particular run (layer 3).
-   Use command-line options to change things that commonly change (layer 4).
-   Format configuration files using [YAML][yaml].
