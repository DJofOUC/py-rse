-   The purpose of testing is to convince people (including yourself) that software is correct enough
    and to make tolerances on 'enough' explicit.
-   Add [assertions][assertion] to your code so that it checks itself as it runs.
-   Write [unit tests][unit_test] to check small “units” or pieces of your code.
-   Write [integration tests][integration_test] to check that multiple units work correctly together.
-   Write [regression tests][regression_testing] to check if your code is behaving differently than before. 
-   A [test framework][test_framework] finds and runs tests written in a prescribed fashion and reports their results.
-   Test [coverage][code_coverage] refers to how many lines of code are executed by a test suite. 
-   [Continuous integration][continuous_integration] re-builds and/or re-tests software every time something changes.
