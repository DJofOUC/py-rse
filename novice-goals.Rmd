# Novice Goals {#novice-goals}

This outline describes the questions that the novice courses on R and Python will answer.
The advanced course can then assume that learners have hands-on experience with these topics
but nothing more.

## Data analysis

-   How can I represent and manage missing values?
    -   NA
    Python Learning Objectives
    -   Identify missing values (e.g., NaN) in your datasets
    -   Examine the impact of missing valus on your datasets
    -   Demonstrate and use commands that process missing values
    -   Demonstrate how to replace missing values

    Python Lecture Notes (general info) 
    -   Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)
    -   Missing at Random (MAR)
    -   Missing Not at Random (MNAR)
    -   Missing data at scale (what's a little and what's alot?)
    -   Imputation and Multiple Imputation 
    -   When summing the data, missing values will be treated as zero
    -   If all values are missing, the sum will be equal to NaN
    -   cumsum() and cumprod() methods ignore missing values but preserve them in the resulting arrays
    -   Missing values in GroupBy method are excluded (just like in R)
    -   Many descriptive statistics methods have skipna option to control if missing data should be excluded . This value is set to True by default (unlike R) 

    Python Lecture Notes (useful commands)
    -   Table: df.method() / description
    -   dropna() / drop missing observations
    -   dropna(how='all') / drop observations where all cells are NA
    -   dropna(axis=1,how='all') / drop coloumn if all values are missing
    -   dropna(thresh=5) / drop rows that contain less than 5 non-missing values
    -   fillna(0) / replace missing values with zeros
    -   isnull() returns True if the value is missing
    -   isnotnull() / Returns True for non-missing values

    T/F Exercises (#Review4Everybody)
    -   Imputation is really just making up data to artificially inflate results.  It’s better to just drop cases with missing data than to impute.
    -   (need descriptive stats lesson first) I can just impute the mean for any missing data.  It won’t affect results, and improves power.
    -   Missing data isn’t really a problem if I’m just doing simple statistics.
    -   When imputing, it’s important that the imputations be plausible data points.
