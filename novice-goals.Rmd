# Novice Goals {#novice-goals}

This outline describes the questions that the novice courses on R and Python will answer.
The advanced course can then assume that learners have hands-on experience with these topics
but nothing more.

## Personas

### Anya

**Anya** is a professor of neuropsychology
who is responsible for teaching her department's introduction to statistics
to 1100 first-year students every year.
(Students complain that the Stats department's introductory course is too theoretical
and requires more programming knowledge than they have.)
When she finds time for it,
her research focuses on color perception in infants.

Over the past nine years,
Anya has designed and run a dozen experiments on 50-100 infant subjects each
and analyzed the results using SPSS and more recently R
(which she taught herself during a sabbatical).
She has never taken a programming course,
and suffers from impostor syndrome when talking to colleagues who are using things like GitHub and R Markdown.

Anya would like to figure out how to use R to teach her intro stats course,
which currently uses a mixture of Excel and SPSS.
She would like to learn more about time series analysis to support her research,
and about tools like Git and R Markdown.

This guide has modular lessons and exercises that she can adapt to use in her course,
and suggestions for how to make learning interactive with a large class size.
She also finds helpful instructions for applying time series analysis to data using R.

### Exton

**Exton** taught business at a community college before joining a friend's startup,
and now does community management for a company that builds healthcare software.
He still teaches Marketing 101 every year to help people with backgrounds like his.

Exton uses Excel to keep track of who is registered for webinars, workshops, and training sessions.
Some of these spreadsheets are created from CSV files
produced by a web-scraping script a summer intern wrote for him a couple of years ago.
Exton doesn't think of himself as a programmer,
but spends hours creating complicated lookup tables in multi-sheet spreadsheets
to help him figure out how many webinar attendees turn into community contributors,
who answers forum posts most frequently,
and so on.

Exton knows there are better ways to do what he's doing,
but feels overwhelmed by the flood of blog posts, tweets, and "helpful" recommendations
he receives from members of the company's engineering team.
He wants someone to tell him where he should start and how long it will take whatever he learns to pay off.

Exton finds 'Merely Useful' after some Googling,
and sees an example of data analysis with spreadsheet data that looks really similar to what he's trying to do.
He carefully works through that particular example,
then goes back and works through some of the earlier material in the book.
He can tell that it won't take long to get this to work with his data.

### Irwin

**Irwin**, 18, is five months into an undergraduate degree in urban planning.
He's read lots of gushing articles in *Wired* about data science,
and was excited by the prospect of learning how to do it,
but dropped his CS 101 course after six weeks because nothing made sense.
(His university's computer science department uses Haskell as an introductory programming language...)
He is doing better in Anya's course (which he is taking as an elective)
but still spends most of his time copying, pasting, and swearing.

Irwin did well in his high school math classes,
and built himself a home page with HTML and CSS in a weekend workshop in grade 11.
He knows how to do simple calculations in Excel,
has accounts on nine different social media sites,
and attends all of his morning classes online.

Anya mentions this guide in one of her classes,
and Irwin downloads the PDF to read on the bus.
He loves the examples that use urban data,
and right away he has tons of ideas about where to get more cool data to analyze.
His urban data science blog is already taking shape in his head.

### Camilla

**Camilla** recently started a job as an assistant professor.
Her department (Medieval Studies) is trying to develop a digital humanities data-science-heavy undergraduate program,
and the undergraduate chair thinks that Camilla has the most programming experience in the department
and has asked her to develop an introduction to programming course for humanities students.

Camilla has dabbled in natural language processing and has learned Python over the course of her previous work,
but she has no experience teaching progamming
and she's not sure what the best way is to teach beginners.
She doesn't want to start from scratch to create a course out of nothing.
She also isn't sure which programming language the new program should focus on.

She finds 'Merely Useful' and feels relieved:
she can pretty much use the book as-is for her course.
She looks up the examples of text and image analysis
and compares how both R and Python approach those kinds of data
to help her make a decision about which language to teach.

### Jordan

**Jordan** is a third-year undergraduate student in ecology.
Two months ago she started working part-time for a professor in her department,
and she's beginning to collect and analyze data from her own experiments with fruit flies.
Her professor has asked her to learn R to do her analysis
and suggested that she sign up for the introduction to quantitative data analysis in R course
that the ecology department offers.
The course is just starting,
and it uses 'Merely Useful' as the textbook.

Jordan can't wait to apply her new programming knowledge to her data,
so she starts reading ahead and trying to use her own data in some of the book's examples.
As she works through examples,
she realizes that she'll need to change a few things about how she records her data in spreadsheets
so that it will be easier to analyze in R.
