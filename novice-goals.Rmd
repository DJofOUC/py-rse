## Data analysis

-   How can I represent and manage missing values?
    -   NA
    Python Learning Objectives
    -   Identify missing values (e.g., NaN) in your datasets
    -   Examine the impact of missing valus on your datasets
    -   Demonstrate and use commands that process missing values
    -   Demonstrate how to replace missing values

    Python Lecture Notes (general info) 
    -   Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)
    -   Missing at Random (MAR)
    -   Missing Not at Random (MNAR)
    -   Missing data at scale (what's a little and what's alot?)
    -   Imputation and Multiple Imputation 
    -   When summing the data, missing values will be treated as zero
    -   If all values are missing, the sum will be equal to NaN
    -   cumsum() and cumprod() methods ignore missing values but preserve them in the resulting arrays
    -   .groupby() method *see more in descriptive stats section* 
        -   Missing values in .groupby() method are excluded (just like in R)
        -   Another .groupby() fun fact: .groupby() with observed=True includes NaNs for categoricals.
    -   Many descriptive statistics methods have skipna option to control if missing data should be excluded . This value is set to True by default (unlike R) 

    Python Lecture Notes (useful commands)
    -   Table: df.method() / description
    -   dropna() / drop missing observations
    -   dropna(how='all') / drop observations where all cells are NA
    -   dropna(axis=1,how='all') / drop coloumn if all values are missing
    -   dropna(thresh=5) / drop rows that contain less than 5 non-missing values
    -   fillna(0) / replace missing values with zeros
    -   isna() returns True if the value is missing
    -   notna() / Returns True for non-missing values

    T/F Exercises (#Review4Everybody)
    -   Imputation is really just making up data to artificially inflate results.  It’s better to just drop cases with missing data than to impute.
    -   (need descriptive stats lesson first) I can just impute the mean for any missing data.  It won’t affect results, and improves power.
    -   Missing data isn’t really a problem if I’m just doing simple statistics.
    -   When imputing, it’s important that the imputations be plausible data points.

    Short Answer Exercises (#Review4Everybody)
    -   What is imputation of missing data?
    -   How does missing values affect results?
    -   How do you computationally mark missing values in your dataset?
    -   How could you handle missing data?

-   How can I get a feel for my data?
    -   summary/descrptive statistics

    Python Learning Objectives 
    -   Recognize the difference between statistics and descriptive statistics
    -   Define four variable types: nomial, ordinal, interval and ratio
    -   Describe the types of descriptive statistics: organize data and summarize data
    -   Demonstrate and use commands that help you describe data 

    Python Lecture Notes (general info)
    -   Discuss basic probability & statistics overview
        -   Identify materials available at https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/
        -   Chapter 1 seems the most relevant at this point
    -   Descriptive statistics quantitatively describes or summarizes features of a dataset. 
    -   Descriptive statistics are used by researchers/analysts to report on populations and samples. 
    -   Descriptive statistics speed up and simplify comprehension of a group’s characteristics
    -   Variable types 
        -   Nominal: Unordered categorical variables
        -   Ordinal: There is an ordering but no implication of equal distance between the different points of the scale.
        -   Interval: There are equal differences between successive points on the scale but the position of zero is arbitrary.
        -   Ratio: The relative magnitudes of scores and the differences between them matter. The position of zero is fixed.
    -   Types of descriptive statistics
        -   Organize data: tables and graphs
        -   Summarize data: central tendency and variation
    -   Tables
        -  frequency distributions, relative frequency distributions
    -   Graphs
        -  bar chart, histogram, boxplot
    -   Central tendency   
        - mean, median, mode
    -   Variation
        - range, interquartile range, variance, standard deviation

    Python Lecture Notes (useful commands)
    -   Import python libraries: 
        -   import pandas as pd
        -   import seaborn as sns
    -   Read data into a dataframe (likely review from another section)
        -   df = pd.read_csv("your-filename.csv") #read a csv file, it better be tidy first!
        -   Note: you can read data from other file formats like excel, stata and sas
    -   df.method() / description
        -   head([n]), tail([n]) / first/last n rows 
        -   describe() / generate descriptive statistics (for numeric columns only) 
        -   shape / return a tuple representing the dimensionality of the dataframe
        -   info() /  prints a dataframe's summary information, e.g., index dtype and column dtypes, non-null values and memory usage
        -   max(), min() / return max/min values for all numeric columns
        -   mean(), median() /  return mean/median values for all numeric columns
        -   std() / standard deviation
        -   sample([n]) / returns a random sample of the data frame
    -   .groupby() method
        -   Splits data into groups based on some criteria you define
        -   Then you can calculate statistics (or apply a function) to each group 
        -   A few performance notes:
            -   It's customary to enact the grouping or splitting of data until it's needed. 
            -   Creating the groupby object only verifies that you have passed a valid mapping
            -   By default, the group keys are sorted during the groupby operation. You may want to pass sort=False for potential speedup
    -   Graphs (Intro to seaborn)
        -   Seaborn package is built on matplotlib but provides high level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics 
        -   It specifically targets statistical data visualization
        -   Reference: https://seaborn.pydata.org/introduction.html
        -   import seaborn as sns
        -   sns.set(): applies the default default seaborn theme, scaling, and color palette
        -   load dataset: e.g., tips = sns.load_dataset("tips") where tips is a tidy df
        -   relplot() method: designed to visualize many different statistical relationships
            -   Example: fmri = sns.load_dataset("fmri") where fmri is a tidy df
            -   Example: sns.relplot(x="timepoint", y="signal", col="region", hue="event", style="event", kind="line", data=fmri)
            -   explain each parameter in kind
        -   catplot() method: helps visualize the relationship between one numeric variable and one (or more) categorical variables
            -   Example: sns.catplot(x="day", y="total_bill", hue="smoker", kind="swarm", data=tips) 
            -   kind parameter can be changed to: violin, bar, etc. 
        -  pairplot() method: shows all pairwise relationships and the marginal distributions, optionally conditioned on a categorical variable
            -   Example: sns.pairplot(data=iris, hue="species")
            -   my personal fav when paired w/ .describe() for some initial EDA
