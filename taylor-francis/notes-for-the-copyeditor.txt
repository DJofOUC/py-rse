## General style 

Spelling: UK (e.g. colour)  /  US (e.g. color)

US spelling

Endings: ize (theorize)  /  ise (theorise)

Use -ize endings

Serial commas: Yes (this, that, and the other)  /  No (this, that and the other) 

Serial commas (weÕre not barbarians)

Quotation marks: single with double within ('the "new" regime')  /  double with single within ("the 'new' regime")

Double with single within.

Punctuation: outside quotation marks ("it is a fresh start".)  /  inside quotation marks ("it is a fresh start.")

Outside for terms, inside for quoted speech.

Acronyms: unpointed (USA)  /  pointed (U.S.A.)

Unpointed

Dashes: spaced en dash (The essay — first published in 1960 — addresses this question.)  /  unspaced em dash (The essay—first published in 1960—addresses this question.)

Unspaced em dash.

Numbers
* spelled out to ten, Arabic thereafter (one to ten, 11–20)  /  another system (please describe)
* maximum number spans (135–136)  /  minimum number spans (135–6)

Spelled out to ten, numeric after that. I don"t believe we have any number spans.

Dates: 7 June 1918  /  June 7, 1918

June 7, 1918 (but dates in example data files are written 1918-06-07, so please don"t correct those).

First letter after colons: lower-case  /  capitalized

Lower case (continuation of sentence).

Bulleted and numbered lists: 
* Each line begins with a capital letter  /  lower-case letter
* Each line ends with a full stop  /  semi-colon  /  nothing
* Another system (please describe)

If the points are full sentences or multiple sentences, they are sentence-cased (start with capital letter). If they are single words or short phrases, no punctuation, and if they are fragments of a sentence written out as a list for clarity with one point per phrase, a comma at the end of every line except the last (which ends with a full stop).

Figures and tables: Should there be an in-text reference for every figure and table, e.g. "see Figure 7.9"?

Yes

## Referencing style

Pointed and unspaced.
