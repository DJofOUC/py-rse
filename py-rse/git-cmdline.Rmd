# Git at the Command Line {#py-rse-git-cmdline}

```{r py-rse-git-cmdline-setup, include=FALSE}
source(here::here("_common.R"))
```

The first two volumes in this series introduced version control with Git
using a graphical interface like [GitKraken][gitkraken] or [the RStudio IDE][rstudio-ide].
These interfaces are actually wrappers around Git's original command-line interface,
which allows us to access all of Git's features.
This lesson describes how the basic cycle of add, commit, push, and pull works at the command line.

To illustrate with the Zipf's Law project, 
we will start by putting our work up to this point in git.  
Then, to illustrate the version control cycle, 
we'll edit our, `plotcounts.py` script to produce a more useful plot.

The `zipfs-law/` project directory, should currently look like this:
```
├── bin
│   ├── book_summary.sh
│   ├── countwords.py
│   ├── collate.py
│   ├── plotcounts.py
│   └── mymodule.py
├── data
│   ├── dracula.txt 
|   ├── frankenstein.txt
|   └── ...
└── results
    ├── dracula.csv
    ├── jane_eyre.csv
    ├── jane_eyre.png
    └── moby_dick.csv
```


## How can I set up Git for command-line use? {#py-rse-git-cmdline-setup}

On a command line,
we write Git commands as <code>git <em>verb</em> <em>options</em></code>,
where the [subcommand][subcommand] <code><em>verb</em></code> tells Git what we want to do
and <code><em>options</em></code> provide any additional optional information that subcommand needs.
Using this syntax,
the first thing we need to do is configure Git:

```shell
$ git config --global user.name "Amira Khan"
$ git config --global user.email "amira@zipfs.org"
```

(Please use your own name and email address instead of the one shown.)
Here,
`config` is the verb
and the rest of the command are options.
We put the name in quotation marks because it contains a space;
we don't actually need to quote the email address,
but do so for consistency.
Since we are going to be using [GitHub][github],
the email address should be the same as the one we used when setting up our GitHub account.

These two commands only need to be run once:
the flag `--global` tells Git to use the settings for all of our projects on this computer.
We can re-run these commands any time if you want to change our details.
We can also check our settings:

```shell
$ git config --list
```

```text
user.name=Amira Khan
user.email=amira@zipfs.org
core.autocrlf=input
core.editor=nano
core.repositoryformatversion=0
core.filemode=true
core.bare=false
core.ignorecase=true
```

> If you forget a Git command,
> we can get a list of the ones available using `--help`.
> This option will also give us more information about specific commands.

> ```shell
> $ git --help
> $ git config --help
> ```

## How can I create a new repository? {#py-rse-git-cmdline-repos}

Once Git is configured, we can start using it.
This section will cover how to create a Git repository associated with a project folder.

Most of the commands we will use (such as `git add` and `git commit`) will sound familiar,
as the same terminology is used in graphical interfaces like [GitKraken][gitkraken] and [the RStudio IDE][rstudio-ide].

Let's get the Zipf's law project into git.
First, we need to make sure we are in the `zipfs-law/` directory 
(that is, the top-level directory of our Zipf's law project):
```shell
$ cd ~/zipfs-law
$ ls
```
```text
 bin       data      results
```

To tell Git to make this directory a [repository][repository],
i.e.,
a place where Git can store versions of our files, 
use the `init` command:
```shell
$ git init .
```

```text
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/amira/zipfs-law/.git/
```

`ls` seems to show that the directory hasn't changed:

```shell
$ ls
```
```text
bin     data    results
```

But if we add the `-a` flag to show everything,
we can see that Git has created a hidden directory within `zipfs-law` called `.git`:

```shell
$ ls -a
```

```text
.       ..      .git    bin     data    results
```

Git stores information about the project in this special subdirectory.
If we ever delete it,
we will lose that history.

We can check that everything is set up correctly
by asking Git to tell us the status of our project:

```shell
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        bin/
        data/
        results/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

We have "no commits yet", and git has recognized the existing folders, `bin/`, `data/` and `results/`, are not yet tracked in version control.

## How can I add existing work to a Git repository? {#py-rse-git-cmdline-add-existing}

Now that we have a repository for our work,
we can add files to it and track their history. 
This section will cover adding our existing work to our new repository.

To start, let's make sure we're still in the right directory:

```shell
$ cd ~/zipfs-law
```

Then check the status, to see that we have untracked files: 
```shell
$ git status
```
```text
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        bin/
        data/
        results/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
"Untracked files" means there is a file in the directory whose history Git isn't tracking.
This is often the case when we initialize a Git repo in an existing directory --- 
the work we've already done is in the directory 
but Git won't automatically track it.

We can tell Git to start keeping track of files or directories using `git add`.
We can add single files:
```shell
$ git add bin/countwords.py
```
Or entire directories:
```shell
$ git add bin
```

With an existing project 
we often want to tell Git to track all the files that are already there, 
in which case, pass the current directory, `.`:

```shell
$ git add .
```

Then we can check the status to see all the files that have been added:
```shell
$ git status
```
```text
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   bin/book_summary.sh
        new file:   bin/collate.py
        new file:   bin/countwords.py
        new file:   bin/mymodule.py
        new file:   bin/plotcounts.py
        new file:   data/dracula.txt
        new file:   data/frankenstein.txt
        new file:   data/jane_eyre.txt
        new file:   data/moby_dick.txt
        new file:   data/sense_and_sensibility.txt
        new file:   data/sherlock_holmes.txt
        new file:   data/time_machine.txt
        new file:   results/dracula.csv
        new file:   results/jane_eyre.csv
        new file:   results/moby_dick.csv
        new file:   results/jane_eyre.png
```

Adding all your existing files is a dangerous operation,
since it's easy to inadvertently add files that should never be in version control --- things that may contain passwords, 
access tokens,
or other potentially sensitive information.
Carefully check this list of files to be committed 
for anything that shouldn't be there.  

While you always want to version your script files 
(e.g. in this case, the files in `bin/`), 
here we've chosen to also include our original data files, 
result files, and image files in version control. 
This should be a project specific decision --- 
for instance, you might not want to include these files if they
are large or in a binary format. 
You'll learn more about how to make the decision of
what does and doesn't go in version control 
in Chapter \@ref(py-rse-project).

We now have no "untracked files", 
but the tracked files haven't been committed to our history.
Commit changes with `git commit`:
```shell
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
```text
(base) zipfs-law: git commit -m "Initial commit"
[master (root-commit) 31a216a] Initial commit

 create mode 100644 results/jane_eyre.csv
 create mode 100644 results/jane_eyre.png
 create mode 100644 results/moby_dick.csv
```
When we run `git commit`,
Git takes everything we have told it to save by using `git add`
and stores a copy permanently inside the special `.git` directory.
This permanent copy is called a [commit][commit] or a [revision][revision].
In this case,
its [short identifier][short-identifier-git] is `31a216a`;
your commit may have another identifier.

We use the `-m` option (short for <strong>m</strong>essage)
to record a short descriptive that will remind us later what we did and why.
If we just run `git commit` without the `-m` option,
Git will launch `nano`
(or whatever other editor is configured using `git config --global core.editor`)
so that we can write a longer [commit message][commit-message].
Once again,
we put the message in double quotes because it contains spaces.

If we run `git status` now:
```shell
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
Git tells us all of our existing work is tracked and up to date.  

This first commit becomes the first point in our Git history --- 
you can't time travel back beyond this point. 
This means you generally want to initialize your project as a Git repository sooner rather than later.

## How can I save and track changes? {#py-rse-git-cmdline-changes}

Our initial commit gives us a starting point in our history.
Now, let's see how we might record the history of a new file. 
The process is similar to adding our existing work: 
first add the file, then commit changes.

Again, verify you are still in the right directory:

```shell
$ cd ~/zipfs-law
```

Let's use our `plotcounts.py` program to generate 
a plot of the word counts in `results/dracula.csv`:
```shell
python bin/plotcounts.py results/dracula.csv --outfile results/dracula.png
```

We can check the status of our repo again:
```shell
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        results/dracula.png

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Since `results/dracula.png` is a new file, git isn't tracking it yet.
Let's add it, and commit it:
```shell
$ git add results/dracula.png
$ git commit -m "Add plot of word counts for 'Dracula'"
```
```text
[master 65b7e61] Add plot of word counts for 'Dracula'
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 results/dracula.png
```

If we want to know what we've done recently,
we can display the project's history using `git log`:
```shell
$ git log
```

```text
commit 65b7e6129f978f6b99bae6b16c5704a9ce079afa (HEAD -> master)
Author: Amira Khan <amira@zipfs.org>
Date:   Thu Feb 20 10:46:19 2020 -0800

    Add plot of word counts for 'Dracula'

commit 31a216a6119de9a8d2233e5e275af9a2967415af
Author: Amira Khan <amira@zipfs.org>
Date:   Wed Feb 19 15:39:04 2020 -0800

    Initial commit
```

`git log` lists all commits made to a repository in reverse chronological order.
The listing for each commit includes
the commit's [full identifier][full-identifier-git]
(which starts with the same characters as the short identifier printed by `git commit` earlier),
the commit's author,
when it was created,
and the log message Git was given when the commit was created.

The plot (Figure \@ref(fig:py-rse-git-cmdline-initial-plot)) we've made is a little sub-optimal, 
because most of the visual space
is devoted to the ten to twenty words with very high frequency and 
it is hard to see what is happening with the other, more than 10,000, words.
```{r py-rse-git-cmdline-initial-plot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Inverse rank versus word frequency for Dracula"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/py-rse-git-cmdline/plot-initial.png")
```

An alternative way to visually evaluate Zipf's Law is to plot
the word frequency against rank on log-log axes. Let's edit `plotcounts.py` to create this alternative plot.

We can make the change by editing the line:
```python
    df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency', y='inverse_rank',
                    figsize=[12, 6], grid=True, xlim=args.xlim)
```

To put `'rank'` on the y-axis and add `loglog=True`:
```python
    df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency', y='rank', loglog=True,
                    figsize=[12, 6], grid=True, xlim=args.xlim)
```

When we run `git status` now,
it tells us that a file it already knows about has been modified:

```shell
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   bin/plotcounts.py

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

The last line is the key phrase:
"no changes added to commit".
We have changed this file,
but we haven't told Git we want to save those changes
(which we do with `git add`)
nor have we saved them
(which we do with `git commit`).

Let's do that now.
It is good practice to review our changes before saving them,
which we can do with `git diff`.
This command shows us the differences between the current state of our repository
and the most recently saved version:

```shell
$ git diff
```

```diff
diff --git a/bin/plotcounts.py b/bin/plotcounts.py
index 13e7f38..a6005cd 100644
--- a/bin/plotcounts.py
+++ b/bin/plotcounts.py
@@ -8,7 +8,7 @@ def main(args):
     df = pd.read_csv(args.infile, header=None, names=('word', 'word_frequency'))
     df['rank'] = df['word_frequency'].rank(ascending=False)
     df['inverse_rank'] = 1 / df['rank']
-    df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency', y='inverse_rank',
+    df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency', y='rank', loglog = True,
                     figsize=[12, 6], grid=True, xlim=args.xlim)
     plt.savefig(args.outfile)
```

The output is cryptic (even by the standards of the Unix command line)
because it is actually a series of commands telling editors and other tools
how to turn the file we *had* into the file we *have*.
If we break it down into pieces:

1.  The first line tells us that Git is producing output
    in the format of the Unix `diff` command.
2.  The second line tells exactly which versions of the file Git is comparing:
    `13e7f38` and `a6005cd` are unique computer-generated labels for those versions.
3.  The third and fourth lines once again show the name of the file being changed;
    the name appears twice in case we are renaming a file as well as modifying it.
4.  The remaining lines show us the changes and the lines on which they occur.
    A minus sign `-` in the first column indicates a line that is being removed,
    while a plus sign `+` shows a line that is being added. Lines without either
    plus or minus signs have not been changed, but are provided around the lines
    that have been changed to add context.
    
To be specific,
this `diff` is describing that this line in the file was removed:
```python
    df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency', y='inverse_rank',
```
and this line was added:
```python
    df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency', y='rank', loglog = True,
```

After reviewing our change
we can commit it just as we did before:

```shell
$ git commit -m "Edit to plot frequency against rank on log-log axes"
```

```text
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
        modified:   bin/plotcounts.py

no changes added to commit
```

Whoops:
we forgot to add the file to the set of things we want to commit.
Let's fix that:

```shell
$ git add bin/plotcounts.py
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   bin/plotcounts.py
```

```shell
$ git commit -m "Edit to plot frequency against rank on log-log axes"
```

```text
[master b5176bf] Edit to plot frequency against rank on log-log axes
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

Let's take a look at our new plot (Figure \@ref(fig:py-rse-git-cmdline-loglog-plot)):
```shell
python bin/plotcounts.py results/dracula.csv --outfile results/dracula.png
```

```{r py-rse-git-cmdline-loglog-plot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Rank versus word frequency, on log-log axes, for Dracula"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/py-rse-git-cmdline/plot-loglog.png")
```
We are still looking for a linear relationship, 
although now it will be negative, rather than positive. 
The low frequency words (below about 120 instances)
seem to follow a straight line very closely, 
but we currently have to make this evaluation by eye.
In the next chapter, we'll write code to fit and add a 
line to our plot.

Checking `git status` again reveals our plot file has
been modified:
```text
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   results/dracula.png

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

But, since `results/dracula.png` is a binary file 
`git diff` isn't very informative:
```diff
diff --git a/results/dracula.png b/results/dracula.png
index d8162ac..e9fe7f8 100644
Binary files a/results/dracula.png and b/results/dracula.png differ
```
It simply tells us the new file is different from the old one.

If we are sure we want to commit all of our changes,
we can combine `git add` and `git commit` into a single command.
To save our work in one step give `git commit` the `-a` option:

```shell
$ git commit -a -m "Update dracula plot"
```

```text
[master d77bc5c] Update dracula plot
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 rewrite results/dracula.png (99%)
```

## How can I synchronize with other repositories? {#py-rse-git-cmdline-remotes}

Sooner or later our computer will experience a hardware failure,
be stolen,
or be thrown in the lake by someone who thinks we shouldn't spend the *entire* vacation working on our thesis.
Even before that happens
we will probably want to collaborate with others,
which we can do by linking our local repository to one stored on a hosting service such as [GitHub][github].

The first step in doing that is to create an account on GitHub if we don't already have one,
and then to create a new repository to synchronize with.
The remote repository doesn't have to have the same name as the local one,
but we will probably get confused if they are different,
so the repository we create on GitHub will also be called `zipfs-law`.

The next step is to connect the two repositories.
We do this by making the GitHub repository a [remote][remote-repository] for the local repository.
The home page of the repository on GitHub includes the string we need to identify it
(Figure \@ref(fig:py-rse-git-cmdline-repo-link)).

```{r py-rse-git-cmdline-repo-link, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Where to Find the Repository Link"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/py-rse-git-cmdline/repo-link.png")
```

We can click on "HTTPS" to change the URL from SSH to HTTPS
and then copy that URL.

> **HTTPS vs. SSH**
>
> We use HTTPS here because it does not require additional configuration.
> You may want to set up SSH access,
> which is a bit more secure,
> by following one of the tutorials from [GitHub][git-ssh-github],
> [Bitbucket][git-ssh-bitbucket],
> or [GitLab][git-ssh-gitlab]
> (the last of which includes a screencast).

Next,
let's go into the local `zipfs-law` repository and run this command:

```shell
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/amira/zipfs-law.git
```

Make sure to use the URL for your repository instead of the one shown:
the only difference should be that it includes your username instead of `amira`.

A Git remote is like a bookmark:
it gives a short name to a URL.
In this case,
the remote's name is `origin`;
we could use anything we want,
but `origin` is Git's default,
so we will stick with it.
We can check that the command has worked by running `git remote -v`
(where the `-v` option is short for <strong>v</strong>erbose):

```shell
$ git remote -v
```

```text
origin	https://github.com/amira/zipfs-law.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/amira/zipfs-law.git (push)
```

Git displays two lines because it's actually possible to set up a remote
to download from one URL but upload to another.
Sensible people don't do this,
so we won't explore this possibility any further.

Once we have set up the remote,
we can [push][git-push] the work we have done so far to the repository on GitHub:

```shell
$ git push origin master
```

This may prompt us to enter our username and password;
once we do that,
we see a few lines of administrative information:

```text
Enumerating objects: 33, done.
Counting objects: 100% (33/33), done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (33/33), done.
Writing objects: 100% (33/33), 2.12 MiB | 799.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 33 (delta 5), reused 0 (delta 0)
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (5/5), done.
To https://github.com/amira/zipfs-law.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
Branch 'master' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'origin'.
```

If we view our GitHub repository in the browser,
we will now see that it includes all of our project files,
along with all of the commits we made to create it (Figure \@ref(fig:py-rse-git-cmdline-history)).

```{r py-rse-git-cmdline-history, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Repository history on GitHub"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/py-rse-git-cmdline/repo-history.png")
```

We can now [pull][git-pull] changes from the remote repository to the local one as well:

```shell
$ git pull origin master
```

```text
From https://github.com/amira/zipfs-law
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Already up-to-date.
```

Pulling has no effect in this case
because the two repositories are already synchronized.

## How can I explore a project's history? {#py-rse-git-cmdline-history}

We have now made a few changes to our project.
Git lets us look at the previous versions of the project files
and restore specific files to earlier states if we want to.
To do this,
we need to use an identifier that indicates the versions we want.

There are two ways to do this,
which are similar in spirit to [absolute][absolute-path] and [relative][relative-path] paths.
The "absolute" version is the unique identifier that Git gives to each commit.
These identifiers are 40 characters long,
but in most situations Git will let us use just the first half dozen characters or so.
For example,
if we run `git log` right now,
it shows us something like this:

    Initial commit
```

The commit in which we changed `plotcounts.py` has the absolute 
identifier `b5176bfd2ce9650ad5e79e117cd68a666c9cdabc`, but we
can only need to provide `b5176bf` to reference this commit.

Perhaps you noticed we no longer need the line of code in `plotcounts.py` 
that calculates the inverse rank:
```python
df['inverse_rank'] = 1 / df['rank'] 
```

Let's delete the line from `bin/plotcounts.py`.
Then `git diff` on its own will show the difference between the file as it is now
and the most recent version:

```diff

Note that you may need to use a different identifier than `b5176bf`.
Note also that we have *not* committed this change:
we will look at ways of undoing it in the next section.

The "relative" version of history relies on a special identifier called `HEAD`,
which always refers to the most recent version in the repository.
`git diff -r HEAD` (where the option `-r` is short for <strong>r</strong>evision)
shows the same thing as `git diff`.
Instead of typing in a version identifier to back up one commit,
though,
we can simply use `HEAD~1` (where `~` is the tilde symbol).
This shorthand is read "HEAD minus one",
and gives us the difference to the *previous* saved version.
`git diff -r HEAD~2` goes back two revisions and so on.

We can also look at the differences between two saved versions
by separating their identifiers with two dots `..` like this:

```shell
$ git diff -r HEAD~1..HEAD~2
```

```diff
diff --git a/bin/plotcounts.py b/bin/plotcounts.py
index a6005cd..13e7f38 100644

If we want to see the changes made in a particular commit,
we can use `git show`;
we do not need the `-r` option in this case:

```shell
$ git show HEAD~1 bin/plotcounts.py

## How can I restore old versions of files? {#py-rse-git-cmdline-restore}

We can see what we changed,
but how can we restore it?
Let's suppose we change our mind about the last update to `bin/plotcounts.py`
before we add it or commit it.
`git status` tells us that the file has been changed,
but those changes haven't been [staged][git-stage]:

```shell
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   bin/plotcounts.py

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

We can put things back the way they were in the last saved revision using `git checkout`:

```shell
$ git checkout HEAD bin/plotcounts.py
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

```shell
$ head -n 12 bin/plotcounts.py | tail -n 3 
```

```text
    df['rank'] = df['word_frequency'].rank(ascending=False)
    df['inverse_rank'] = 1 / df['rank']
    df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency', y='rank', loglog = True,
                    figsize=[12, 6], grid=True, xlim=args.xlim)
```

As its name suggests,
`git checkout` checks out (i.e., restores) an old version of a file.
In this case,
we told Git to recover the version of the file saved in `HEAD`,
i.e.,
in the most recent commit.
We can use a commit identifier to go back as far as we want:

```shell
$ git checkout 65b7e61 bin/countwords.py
```
Doing this does *not* change the history:
`git log` still shows our four commits.
Instead,
it replaces the content of the file with the old content:

```shell
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   bin/plotcounts.py
```

Notice that the changes have already been added to the staging area for new commits.
We can bring the file back in sync with the most recent commit using `git checkout`:

```shell
$ git checkout HEAD bin/countwords.py
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   bin/plotcounts.py
```

```shell
$ head -n 12 bin/plotcounts.py | tail -n 3 
```

```text
    df['rank'] = df['word_frequency'].rank(ascending=False)
    df['inverse_rank'] = 1 / df['rank']
    df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency', y='rank', loglog = True,
                    figsize=[12, 6], grid=True, xlim=args.xlim)
```


Since we didn't commit the change that 
removed the line that calculates the inverse rank,
that work is now lost:
Git can only go back and forth between committed versions of files.

## How can I tell Git to ignore some files? {#py-rse-git-cmdline-ignore}

We have only modified one file at a time in this tutorial,
but everything we have done works just as well with multiple files.
Sometimes,
though,
we don't want Git to track files' history.
For example,
we might want to track text files with names ending in `.txt`
but not data files with names ending in `.dat`.

To stop Git from telling us about these files every time we call `git status`,
we can create a file in the root directory of our project called `.gitignore`.
This file can contain filenames like `thesis.pdf`
or [wildcard][wildcard] patterns like `*.dat`.
Each must be on a line of its own,
and Git will ignore anything that matches any of these lines.

> **Remember to Ignore**
>
> Don't forget to commit `.gitignore` to your repository
> so that Git knows to use it.

## Exercises {#py-rse-git-cmdline-exercises}

### Places to create Git repositories {#py-rse-git-cmdline-ex-places}

Along with information about the Zipf's law project,
Amira would also like to keep some notes on 
[Heaps' Law][heaps-law].
Despite her colleagues' concerns,
Amira creates a `heaps-law` project inside her `zipfs-law` project as follows:

```shell
$ cd ~/zipfs-law    # go into zipfs-law directory, which is already a Git repository
$ mkdir heaps-law   # make a subdirectory zipfs-law/heaps-law
$ cd heaps-law      # go into heaps-law subdirectory
$ git heaps-law     # make heaps-law a Git repository
```

Is the `git init` command that she runs inside the `heaps-law` subdirectory
required for tracking files stored there?

### Committing changes {#py-rse-git-cmdline-ex-commit}

Which command(s) below would save changes to `myfile.txt` to a local Git repository?

1. ```shell
   $ git commit -m "my recent changes"
   ```

2. ```shell
   $ git init myfile.txt
   $ git commit -m "my recent changes"
   ```

3. ```shell
   $ git add myfile.txt
   $ git commit -m "my recent changes"
   ```

4. ```shell
   $ git commit -m myfile.txt "my recent changes"
   ```

### Committing multiple files {#py-rse-git-cmdline-ex-multiple}

The staging area can hold changes from any number of files
that you want to commit as a single snapshot.

1.  Create a new file `about.txt` and add a one sentence summary of the project.

2.  Create another new file `project-members.txt`
    and add your name.

3.  Add changes from both files to the staging area
    and commit those changes.

### Write a biography {#py-rse-git-cmdline-ex-bio}

-   Create a new Git repository on your computer called `bio`.
-   Write a three-line biography for yourself in a file called `me.txt` and commit your changes.
-   Modify one line and add a fourth line.
-   Display the differences between the file's original state and its updated state.

### Ignoring nested files {#py-rse-git-cmdline-ex-ignore-nested}

Suppose our project has a directory `results` with two subdirectories called `data` and `plots`.
How would we ignore all of the files in `results/plots`
but not ignore files in `results/data`?

### Including specific files {#py-rse-git-cmdline-ex-include}

How would you ignore all `.dat` files in your root directory except for `final.dat`?
(Hint: find out what the exclamation mark `!` means in a `.gitignore` file.)

### Exploring the GitHub interface {#py-rse-git-cmdline-ex-github-interface}

Browse to your `zipfs-law` repository on GitHub.
Under the `Code` tab,
find and click on the text that says "NN commits" (where "NN" is some number).
Hover over and click on the three buttons to the right of each commit.
What information can you gather/explore from these buttons?
How would you get that same information in the shell?

### GitHub timestamps {#py-rse-git-cmdline-ex-timestamp}

-   Create a remote repository on GitHub.
-   Push the contents of your local repository to the remote.
-   Make changes to your local repository and push these changes as well.
-   Go to the repo you just created on GitHub and check the timestamps of the files.

How does GitHub record times, and why?

### Push versus commit {#py-rse-git-cmdline-ex-push-commit}

How is `git push` different from `git commit`?

### License and README files {#py-rse-git-cmdline-ex-boilerplate}

When we initialized our GitHub repo,
we didn't add a `README.md` or license file.
If we had,
what would have happened when we tried to link our local and remote repositories?

### Recovering older versions of a file {#py-rse-git-cmdline-ex-recover}

Jennifer made changes this morning to a shell script called `data_cruncher.sh`
that she has been working on for weeks.
Her changes broke the script,
and she has now spent an hour trying to get it back in working order.
Luckily,
she has been keeping track of her project's versions using Git.
Which of the commands below can she use
to recover the last committed version of her script?

1.  `$ git checkout HEAD`
2.  `$ git checkout HEAD data_cruncher.sh`
3.  `$ git checkout HEAD~1 data_cruncher.sh`
4.  `$ git checkout <unique ID of last commit> data_cruncher.sh`
5.  Both 2 and 4

### Workflow and history {#py-rse-git-cmdline-ex-history}

What is the output of the last command in the sequence below?

```
$ cd zipfs-law
$ echo "Zipf's Law describes the relationship between the frequency and rarity of words." > motivation.txt
$ git add motivation.txt
$ echo "Zipf's Law suggests the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank." > motivation.txt
$ git commit -m "Motivation for project"
$ git checkout HEAD motivation.txt
$ cat motivation.txt
```

1. ```text
   Zipf's Law describes the relationship between the frequency and rarity of words.
   ```

2. ```
   Zipf's Law suggests the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank.
   ```

3. ```
   Zipf's Law describes the relationship between the frequency and rarity of words.
   Zipf's Law suggests the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank.
   ```

4. An error message because we have changed `motivation.txt` without committing first.

### Understanding `git diff` {#py-rse-git-cmdline-ex-diff}

-   What will the command `git diff HEAD~9 bin/plotcounts.py` do if we run it?
-   What does it actually do?
-   What does `git diff HEAD bin/plotcounts.py` do?

### Getting rid of staged changes {#py-rse-git-cmdline-ex-unstage}

`git checkout` can be used to restore a previous commit when unstaged changes have been made,
but will it also work for changes that have been staged but not committed?
To find out:

-   Change `bin/plotcounts.py`.
-   `git add` that change.
-   Use `git checkout` to see if you can remove your change.

Does it work?

### Figuring out who did what {#py-rse-git-cmdline-ex-blame}

Run the command `git blame bin/plotcounts.py`.

-   What does each line of the output show?
-   Why do some lines start with a circumflex `^`?

## Key Points {#py-rse-git-cmdline-keypoints}

```{r, child="keypoints/rse-git-cmdline.md"}
```

```{r, child="./links.md"}
```
