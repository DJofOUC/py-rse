# Continuous Integration {#py-rse-ci}

```{r py-rse-ci-setup, include=FALSE}
source(here::here("_common.R"))
```

[Continuous integration][continuous-integration] (CI) a simple idea:
merge and test changes to a project automatically and frequently
so that developers get feedback about problems
while those changes are still fresh in their minds.
Automation tools like Make (Chapter \@ref(py-rse-automate)) can compile software,
run tests,
re-do analyses,
and re-create reports with a single command;
CI tools run those commands and give users feedback every time
something changes in the project's repository.
These tools can also be set up to run tests with several different configurations of the software
or on several different operating systems,
so that (for example) if a programmer makes a change on Windows
that would break something for Mac users or vice versa,
they find out before their friends' lives are disrupted.

This chapter introduces a CI tool called [Travis CI][travis-ci]
that integrates well with [GitHub][github].
If Travis CI has been set up,
then every time a change is committed to a GitHub repository,
Travis CI creates a fresh environment,
checks out a copy of the project,
and runs whatever commands the project's managers have set up.
If the project uses a language like C++ or Java,
those commands usually start by compiling the source code to create a runnable program
(Figure \@ref(fig:py-rse-ci-conceptual)).
If we want to reassure ourselves that our software works,
we can create unit tests as described in Chapter \@ref(py-rse-correct)
and tell Travis CI to run them as well
so that (for example) we know whether the code on a branch is working
before we merge it into the master branch (Section \@ref(py-rse-git-advanced-merge)).
We can also do more with Travis CI.
For example,
we can get Travis CI to re-create the PDF and HTML versions of this book
every time a pull request is merged.

## How do I set up continuous integration? {#py-rse-ci-basic}

We have to do five things to set up continuous integration:

1.  Create an account with [Travis CI][travis-ci].
1.  Link our Travis CI account to our GitHub account.
1.  Tell Travis CI to watch the repository that contains our project.
1.  Create a `.travis.yml` file in your repository
    to tell Travis CI what language we are working in
    and what we want to do.
1.  Commit that `.travis.yml` file to the repository.

Creating an account with an online service is a familiar process for most of us,
but linking our Travis CI account to our GitHub account may be new.
When we do this,
we are not only telling Travis CI who we are on GitHub:
we are also telling GitHub that it's OK for Travis CI to get information about us
via GitHub's [API][api].
This permission is necessary—without it,
we would have to enter our password every time Travis CI wanted to run,
which would hardly count as "automated"—but
we should always check carefully when authorizing a service like this
to make sure we are comfortable with what it is planning to do.

### Watching a repository

We tell Travis CI about our repository through its website interface.
On the left,
besides the "My Repositories",
we can click the "+" to add a repository that is already on GitHub
(Figure \@ref(fig:py-rse-ci-add-repo)).
After finding our repository in the list that pops up,
we flick the switch button so that it is green
(Figure \@ref(fig:py-rse-ci-list-repos)).
If our repository doesn't show up,
we can re-synchronize the list using the green "Sync account" button on the left sidebar.
If it still doesn't appear,
the repository may belong to someone else or be private.

```{r py-rse-ci-add-repo, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="ci-add-repo"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rse-ci/add-repo.png")
```

```{r py-rse-ci-list-repos, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="ci-list-repos"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rse-ci/list-repos.png")
```

### Configuring a project

The next step is to create a file called `.travis.yml`
in the root directory of the repository.
(The leading `.` in the name hides the file from casual listings on Mac or Linux,
but not on Windows.)
This file contains settings that control Travis CI's operation,
and is written in a format called [YAML][yaml] (Appendix \@ref(yaml)).
A simple template `.travis.yml` configuration file looks like this:

```yaml
language: python

python:
- "3.6"

install:
- pip install -r requirements.txt

script:
# if an example build.py file was in the src folder
- python src/build.py
```

-   `language` tells Travis CI which programming language we are using
    so that it knows which of its standard [virtual machine][virtual-machine]
    to use as a starting point for our project.
-   This example uses Python,
    so we tell Travis CI which Python version we want under the `python` key.
    We can ask Travis CI to test our project with several different versions
    by adding more versions to the list.
-   `install` tells Travis CI how to install the software we need for our project.
    For Python projects,
    we can put a list of packages in a file called `requirements.txt`
    and then use `pip` to install them (Chapter \@ref(py-rse-package-py)).
-   Finally,
    the entries under the `script` key tell Travis CI what to do.
    We can put almost anything here provided it doesn't need human interaction
    (i.e., doesn't ask questions).
    In this case,
    our only action is to run `src/build.py`.

After we have add this file to our repository,
Travis CI will obey the instructions in this file
every time a change is pushed to GitHub.
More specifically,
it will:

1.  Create a new Linux virtual machine.
1.  Install the desired version of Python.
1.  Install the software described in `requirements.txt`.
1.  Run the commands below the `script` key.
1.  Report the results at <code>https://travis-ci.org/<em>user</em>/<em>repo</em></code>,
    where <code><em>user/repo</em></code>
    identifies the repository.

Travis CI' summary report tells us whether the build passed,
which is shown in green Figure \@ref(fig:py-rse-ci-build-overview),
or whether it produced warnings or errors,
which are shown in red.

```{r py-rse-ci-build-overview, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Travis Build Overview"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rse-ci/build-overview.png")
```

The log below this overview contains a wealth of information
that can help us debug when the build fails.

## How can I display my project's status on GitHub? {#py-rse-ci-display-github}

Travis CI's dashboard is very useful,
but is also convenient to display the status of the build on our project's GitHub home page
(which most people look at more often).
To add a status badge,
click the "build icon" shown in the top right corner of Figure \@ref(fig:image-github-icon)
to bring up a dialog box.
Select "Markdown" from the "Format" menu list,
then copy the Markdown text displayed in the "Result" box
and paste it into the project's `README.md` file.
(It's best to paste the text right below the page's title so that it will be instantly visible).
Once we commit and push thsi change to GitHub,
our project will now show the badge for its Travis CI status Figure \@ref(fig:image-github-icon).

```{r py-rse-ci-github-icon, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The Travis CI Build Badge"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rse-ci/github-icon.png")
```

> **How Do Badges Work?**
>
> Badges are much simpler than they first appear.
> When someone visits our project,
> GitHub sends them the HTML of the project's home page.
> That page includes a link to an image on Travis CI's site,
> so our browser sends a request to Travis CI.
> The URL tells Travis CI's web server what project we're interested in;
> it then sends back a different image
> depending on the most recently recorded build status for that project.

## How can I use Travis CI to test my project? {#py-rse-ci-testing}

The main reason to set up CI is to test the project every time a change is made.
We still have to write unit tests (Chapter \@ref(py-rse-correct)),
but CI makes those tests much more valuable.

For Python packages, adding `pytest` to the `script` key in the `.travis.yml` file will tell Travis to run the tests:

```yaml
language: python
python:
- "3.6"
install:
- pip install -r requirements.txt
script:
- pytest
```

With this in place,
the Travis CI log located right below the build overview
will contain all of the information that our testing command produces when tests fail.

FIXME: Include example here of what failing tests in Python look like in Travis CI.

We can also have Travis CI report the [code coverage][code-coverage] of our tests (Section \@ref(py-rse-correct-coverage)).

To add code coverage for a Python package,
we add one line to `.travis.yml` to install the code coverage tool
and another to run it:

```yaml
language: python
python:
- "3.6"
install:
- pip install -r requirements.txt
# Install code coverage for CI
- pip install codecov
script:
- pytest
after_success:
# Send to codecov services for report
- codecov
```

We use [`codecov`][codecov] rather than the `coverage` tool described in Section \@ref(py-rse-correct-coverage)
because it is a service like Travis CI.

FIXME: fill in this explanation

## How can I use CI for other purposes? {#py-rse-ci-deploying}

Continuous integration was invented for testing,
but it can be used to automate almost anything.

FIXME: Add an example for deployment Python projects.

## Summary {#py-rse-ci-summary}

FIXME: create concept map for continuous integration.

## Exercises {#py-rse-ci-exercises}

FIXME: Get feedback on this and fill it out more later.

1. Setup Travis CI for the package you've been working on (for the course).
2. Get Travis CI to run unit tests of your package.
3. Write a new unit test in your package that you *know* will fail. Push the changes
up to GitHub.
4. Go through the Travis CI log and see what the log says about the failure and
how to fix it. Since you made it purposefully fail, you will already know how to
fix it, but the point is to get comfortable looking through Travis CI' logs.
5. Correct the test, push to GitHub, and get Travis CI to build your package
successfully.
