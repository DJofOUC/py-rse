We have come a long way since we first met Amira, Jun, and Sami in SectionÂ \@ref(intro-personas).
Shell scripts,
branching,
automated workflows,
healthy team dynamics,
clean code that has been tested, documented, and packaged---all of these take time to learn,
but they have all made us and thousands of our colleagues more productive.
We hope you have enjoyed reading;
if so,
we'd enjoy hearing from you.
