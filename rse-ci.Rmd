## Introduction {#rse-ci-intro}

[Continuous integration](glossary.html#continuous-integration) (CI) in software
development is a simple idea: to frequently merge in ("integrate") additions of or
modifications to code so that a software project gets developed and tested in
small, regular increments. The purpose of CI is to catch bugs or problems early
before they become bigger problems later on. There are automated tools available
that help with building and testing any change to the code in a repository. What
the tools do is download the software repository, run and build the software and
code on the repository, run any tests, and then print out the results of these
builds and tests. That way, you can check if there are any problems with your
software and fix any that occur.

The most widely used CI system is [Travis CI][travis-ci]. It integrates well
with [Github][github], and will run tests on multiple platforms and with
multiple versions of tools. At a minimum, Travis will build the software. If
you want to confirm that your software works as intended, you should create tests
as detailed in Chapter \@ref(unit-tests). If tests exist, Travis will run them
and print the results for you to check. Remember, the tests that the CI runs are
only as good as you've written them.

TODO: Confirm unit test chapter ref.

So why should you use CI? There are several reasons:

1. CI will construct a clean, separate computing environment before building and
testing your software. That gives you a better idea on whether potential users
of your software can actually use it. Often your software will build and work on
*your* computer, but not others' computers because of differences in software
versions, operating systems, and other potential dependency conflicts. So part of
good practice for creating software is to confirm that it works at least on a clean
environment.
2. CI will help you catch problems or bugs sooner, which should reduce your stress
and frustration compared to if you have to hunt for a bug later in the software
development.
3. CI is particularly useful when working on a project with others, as bugs that arise from someone else's code contribution can be harder for you to resolve. Preventing them from being merged in the first place saves time. By encouraging frequent well-tested merges, CI also reduces the problems that can occur when multiple people wait to integrate their work right before a big milestone and then want to merge in many big changes all at once.
4. CI can also be extended and customized to be used in other situations outside
of software projects, like when writing a book or creating a website. Having
the knowledge and skill for using CI can allow you to apply these tools to
other areas of work and ultimately reduce more manual and tedious work tasks.

In this lesson we will show you how to set up Travis for your project.

## The basics of setting up CI on a repository? {#rse-ci-basic}

The general steps for setting up CI are:

1. Go to the [Travis][travis-ci] website and get Travis to start watching the
repository.
1. Create a `.travis.yml` file in your repository.
1. Add some standard commands to the file, like `language` (e.g. Python or R).
1. Add and commit the `.travis.yml` file into your Git repository.
1. Push to the repository to GitHub.

And that is the basic steps involved! Let's go through it in more detail. The very
first thing to do is create a Travis account by linking your GitHub account.
Go to [Travis][travis-ci] and create your profile.

### Travis is watching (your repo)

> Note: This process is for general Travis usage. When working with R projects
or packages, this process is simplified by using the `usethis::use_travis()`
command, which we wil discuss at the [end of this session](#rse-ci-setting-up-with-r).

After the "step-zero" of setting up your Travis account, the first step to using
Travis is to tell it about your repository. Go to [Travis-CI][travis-ci] and
on the left, besides the "My Repositories", click the "+" to add a repository
that is already on GitHub.

```{r image-add-repo, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rse-ci/add-repo.png")
```

Then, find your repository in the list and flick the switch button on (so it is
green). You may have to re-sync the list of repositories with GitHub if you
can't find the repository (green "Sync account" button on the left sidebar).

```{r image-list-repos, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rse-ci/list-repos.png")
```

You've now told Travis to watch the repository for any updated commits and run
any commands as needed.

### Configure your project for Travis

Next we need to create a file called `.travis.yml` in the root directory of the
repository. The leading `.` in the name is used by Unix-like systems (Mac OS or
Linux) to hide the file, but on Windows systems it won't be hidden. This file
contains [YAML](glossary.html#yaml) key-value settings that Travis will use and
interpret. A simple template `.travis.yml` configuration file may look like:

```yaml
# Which programming language to use, e.g. Python
language: ... 

# Python specific. Sets the Python version
python:
- ... 

# Commands to use to install, such as extra software packages
install:
- ... 

# Commands to run in order to build or test your software
script:
- ... 
```

Let's break it down what each key does:

- `language` tells Travis which programming language you're using.
- `python` is specific to when `language` is set to `python` and sets the version
you want to use, e.g. `"3.6"`. You can ask Travis to test our project with
several different versions by adding more `-` items.
- `install` tells Travis how to install the software you need for your package.
For Python packages, the convention is to put a list of packages in a file
called `requirements.txt` for `pip` to use (Chapter \@ref(rse-py-package)).
- `script` tells Travis how to actually run the tests. We can put almost
anything here, provided the code doesn't need human interaction (no question prompts
for answers).

An example file that has the keys filled out might be something like:

```yaml
language: python

python:
- "3.6"

install:
- pip install -r requirements.txt

script:
# if an example build.py file was in the src folder
- python src/build.py 
```

After we've added and committed this file to Git, pushed up to GitHub, and (if 
Travis is watching the GitHub repository) Travis will start. Every time commits
are pushed to the GitHub repository, Travis will:

1. Create a new Linux image.
2. Install the desired version of Python.
3. Install the software described in `requirements.txt`.
4. Run the commands in the `script` key, in this case to run `python src/build.py`.
5. Report the results at `https://travis-ci.org/USER/REPO` (USER is your username,
and REPO is the name of the repository).

Travis' summary report tells us whether the build passed or failed. It fails when
it encounters warnings or errors. In the image below, the main thing to look for
is whether the colour is green and says "passed" (as shown), or if the colours 
are red and the message is "failed" or "error".

```{r image-build-overview, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Travis build overview."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rse-ci/build-overview.png")
```

The log below this overview contains a ton of information, most of which are
only relevant when you start needing to debug why and how your software doesn't
build in a clean, non-local environment (aka. not your own computer). We'll get
into more detail about interpreting the logs and overviews later in the chapter.

### Display CI build status in README

Travis's dashboard is very useful, but it would also be nice to have a short,
quick display of the Travis build status on our software project's README since
that is where people first go to look for information on the project. To add
this status "badge", click the "build icon" as shown in the top right corner of
Figure ... This will bring up a dialog box where you can select the item
"Markdown" in the "Format" menu list. In the "Result" box will be the markdown
text you can copy and paste into your repository's `README.md` file. It's best to
paste the text right below the first `#` header. Commit and push to GitHub and
your project will now show the "badge" for the Travis CI build, like shown in 
the image below.

TODO: Add ref to image?

```{r image-github-icon, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The Travis build badge in the README file on GitHub."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rse-ci/github-icon.png")
```

### Setting up Travis in R {#rse-ci-setting-up-with-r}

In R, setting up and using Travis is greatly simplified by using:

```r
usethis::use_travis()
```

This command does several things at once. It:

- Creates a typical `.travis.yml` configuration file used for R packages.
- Automatically adds a Travis build badge to your `README.md`.
- Opens up the Travis CI website to the page of your package so you can activate
Travis for the repository. Note, this assumes you already have your package on
GitHub and that you have a Travis account.

See the [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/ci.html) webpage for more
details and help on this function.

You've now set up CI for your R or Python software repository! Each new push to
your GitHub repository will trigger Travis to run the specified commands. You
can now start using it to find errors or problems and to making your software
usable to others.

## Using Travis to test your software {#rse-ci-testing}

The primary reason to use CI is to run the package's tests (as we covered in
the [Unit Test] section) and check how those tests perform in a clean environment.
So getting Travis to run the unit tests in your package is fairly easy. For
R packages, running tests is built into Travis CI so you don't need to modify
anything. For Python packages, the `script` key in the `.travis.yml` file needs
to have `pytest` added, like so:

TODO: Reference to unit test chapter.

```yaml
language: python
python:
- "3.6"
install:
- pip install -r requirements.txt
script:
- pytest
```

After committing and pushing to your GitHub repository, Travis will now always
run your tests in it's clean environment. If the tests fail, Travis will update
the status to "failed" or "error". Then you can go through the Travis log and 
start debugging what went wrong, which can sometimes be a very difficult task
and is always different depending on the project, tests, and programming language.
All details about the build are contained in the Travis "Job log", right below
the build overview. Searching for the problem can sometimes be quite tedious.
In the final exercise we'll get you to intentionally fail the Travis build to 
see how it looks.

TODO: Do we want to add more explanation about this? I feel running unit tests are basically the biggest reason to use CI.

## Using CI to test coverage {#rse-ci-coverage}

We can also add code coverage,
which is in Section \@ref(#rse-unit-testing-coverage),
to the CI. To add code coverage to your CI, 
add two more lines to your `.travis.yml` file:

```yaml
language: python
python:
- "3.6"
install:
- pip install -r requirements.txt
# Install code coverage for CI
- pip install codecov
script:
- pytest
after_success:
# Send to codecov services for report
- codecov
```

The CI needs to install the code coverage with `pip`. 
We install `codecov` in this case, 
as it is a [service][codecov] like Travis for reporting on coverage.
To send the code to ...

In **R**, the process is simple. 
Type out and run this command, which it will set everything up:

```r
usethis::use_coverage()
```

This function will add everything needed and list out some instructions to follow.

Your package now has code coverage support!

## How can I use CI for non-testing purposes? {#rse-ci-deploying}

This section is meant only as a brief resource and introduction to using CI for
more than just testing software. For instance, in R if you want to create a
website for your R package, running:

```r
usethis::use_pkgdown()
usethis::use_pkgdown_travis()
```

...will set up the necessary infrastructure to create a website from your package
documentation and to get Travis to automatically build, create, and deploys your
package website to be put online. So for R projects, the `.travis.yml` file
looks something like this after using the above functions:

```yaml
language: R
sudo: false
cache: packages

before_cache: Rscript -e 'remotes::install_cran(\"pkgdown\")
deploy:
  provider: script
  script: Rscript -e 'pkgdown::deploy_site_github()'
  skip_cleanup: true
```

The `deploy` key is the important one here, as it is the one that tells Travis 
to send the generated website files to be put online (via [GitHub Pages][github-pages]).

## Summary {#rse-ci-summary}

FIXME: create concept map for integration.

## Exercises {#rse-ci-exercises}

TODO: Get feedback on this and fill it out more later.

1. Setup Travis CI for the package you've been working on (for the course).
2. Get Travis to run unit tests of your package (not applicable for R packages).
3. Write a new unit test in your package that you *know* will fail. Push the changes
up to GitHub.
4. Go through the Travis CI log and see what the log says about the failure and 
how to fix it. Since you made it purposefully fail, you will already know how to
fix it, but the point is to get comfortable looking through Travis' logs.
5. Correct the test, push to GitHub, and get Travis to build your package
successfully.
