## Setting up Git {#cmdline-git-setup}

When we use Git on a new computer for the first time,
we need to configure a few things. Below are a few examples
of configurations we will set as we get started with Git:

*   our name and email address,
*   what our preferred text editor is,
*   and that we want to use these settings globally (i.e. for every project).

On a command line, Git commands are written as `git verb options`,
where `verb` is what we actually want to do and `options` is additional optional information which may be needed for the `verb`. So here is how
Dracula sets up his new laptop:

```shell
$ git config --global user.name "Vlad Dracula"
$ git config --global user.email "vlad@tran.sylvan.ia"
```

Please use your own name and email address instead of Dracula's.
This user name and email will be associated with your subsequent Git activity,
which means that any changes pushed to
[GitHub](https://github.com/),
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/),
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) or
another Git host server
in a later lesson will include this information.

For these lessons, we will be interacting with [GitHub](https://github.com/) and
so the email address used should be the same as the one used when setting up your GitHub account.
If you are concerned about privacy,
please review [GitHub's instructions for keeping your email address private][git-privacy]. 

Dracula also has to set his favorite text editor, following this table:

| Editor             | Configuration command                            |
|:-------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| Atom | `$ git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"`|
| nano               | `$ git config --global core.editor "nano -w"`    |
| BBEdit (Mac, with command line tools) | `$ git config --global core.editor "bbedit -w"`    |
| Sublime Text (Mac) | `$ git config --global core.editor "/Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl -n -w"` |
| Sublime Text (Win, 32-bit install) | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files (x86)/sublime text 3/sublime_text.exe' -w"` |
| Sublime Text (Win, 64-bit install) | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files/sublime text 3/sublime_text.exe' -w"` |
| Notepad++ (Win, 32-bit install)    | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files (x86)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"`|
| Notepad++ (Win, 64-bit install)    | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"`|
| Kate (Linux)       | `$ git config --global core.editor "kate"`       |
| Gedit (Linux)      | `$ git config --global core.editor "gedit --wait --new-window"`   |
| Scratch (Linux)       | `$ git config --global core.editor "scratch-text-editor"`  |
| Emacs              | `$ git config --global core.editor "emacs"`   |
| Vim                | `$ git config --global core.editor "vim"`   |
| VS Code                | `$ git config --global core.editor "code --wait"`   |

It is possible to reconfigure the text editor for Git whenever you want to change it.

> **Exiting Vim**
>
> Note that Vim is the default editor for many programs.
> If you haven't used Vim before and wish to exit a session
> without saving your changes, press <kbd>Esc</kbd> then type `:q!` and hit <kbd>Return</kbd>.
> If you want to save your changes and quit, press <kbd>Esc</kbd> then type `:wq` and hit <kbd>Return</kbd>.

The four commands we just ran above only need to be run once: the flag `--global` tells Git
to use the settings for every project, in your user account, on this computer.

You can check your settings at any time:

```shell
$ git config --list
```

You can change your configuration as many times as you want: use the
same commands to choose another editor or update your email address.

> **Proxy**
>
> In some networks you need to use a
> [proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server). If this is the case, you
> may also need to tell Git about the proxy:
>
> ```shell
> $ git config --global http.proxy proxy-url
> $ git config --global https.proxy proxy-url
> ```
>
> To disable the proxy, use
>
> ```shell
> $ git config --global --unset http.proxy
> $ git config --global --unset https.proxy
> ```

> **Git Help and Manual**
>
> Always remember that if you forget a `git` command,
> you can access the list of commands by using `-h` and access the Git manual by using `--help` :
>
> ```shell
> $ git config -h
> $ git config --help
> ```


## Creating a repository {#cmdline-git-repos}

Once Git is configured,
we can start using it.

We will continue with the story of Wolfman and Dracula who are investigating if it
is possible to send a planetary lander to Mars.

First, let's create a directory in `Desktop` folder for our work and then move into that directory:

```shell
$ cd ~/Desktop
$ mkdir planets
$ cd planets
```

Then we tell Git to make `planets` a repository â€” a place where Git can store versions of our files:

```shell
$ git init
```

It is important to note that `git init` will create a repository that
includes subdirectories and their files---there is no need to create
separate repositories nested within the `planets` repository,
whether subdirectories are present from the beginning or added later.
Also, note that the creation of the `planets` directory and its initialization as a
repository are completely separate processes.

If we use `ls` to show the directory's contents,
it appears that nothing has changed:

```shell
$ ls
```

But if we add the `-a` flag to show everything,
we can see that Git has created a hidden directory within `planets` called `.git`:

```shell
$ ls -a
```

```text
.	..	.git
```

Git uses this special sub-directory to store all the information about the project, 
including all files and sub-directories located within the project's directory.
If we ever delete the `.git` sub-directory,
we will lose the project's history.

We can check that everything is set up correctly
by asking Git to tell us the status of our project:

```shell
$ git status
```

```text
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

If you are using a different version of `git`, the exact
wording of the output might be slightly different.


## Tracking changes {#cmdline-git-changes}

First let's make sure we're still in the right directory.
You should be in the `planets` directory.

```shell
$ cd ~/Desktop/planets
```

Let's create a file called `mars.txt` that contains some notes
about the Red Planet's suitability as a base.
We'll use `nano` to edit the file;
you can use whatever editor you like.
In particular, this does not have to be the `core.editor` you set globally earlier.

```shell
$ nano mars.txt
```

Type the text below into the `mars.txt` file:

```text
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
```

Let's first verify that the file was properly created by running the list command (`ls`):

```shell
$ ls
```

```text
mars.txt
```

`mars.txt` contains a single line, which we can see by running:

```shell
$ cat mars.txt
```

```text
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
```

If we check the status of our project again,
Git tells us that it's noticed the new file:

```shell
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	mars.txt
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

The "untracked files" message means that there's a file in the directory
that Git isn't keeping track of.
We can tell Git to track a file using `git add`:

```shell
$ git add mars.txt
```

and then check that the right thing happened:

```shell
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   mars.txt

```

Git now knows that it's supposed to keep track of `mars.txt`,
but it hasn't recorded these changes as a commit yet.
To get it to do that,
we need to run one more command:

```shell
$ git commit -m "Start notes on Mars as a base"
```

```text
[master (root-commit) f22b25e] Start notes on Mars as a base
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 mars.txt
```

When we run `git commit`,
Git takes everything we have told it to save by using `git add`
and stores a copy permanently inside the special `.git` directory.
This permanent copy is called a **commit**
(or **revision**) and its short identifier is `f22b25e`.
Your commit may have another identifier.

We use the `-m` flag (for "message")
to record a short, descriptive, and specific comment that will help us remember later on what we did and why.
If we just run `git commit` without the `-m` option,
Git will launch `nano` (or whatever other editor we configured as `core.editor`)
so that we can write a longer message.

Good commit messages start with a brief (<50 characters) statement about the changes made in the commit.
Generally, the message should complete the sentence "If applied, this commit will" <commit message here>.
If you want to go into more detail, add a blank line between the summary line and your additional notes.
Use this additional space to explain why you made changes and/or what their impact will be.

If we run `git status` now:

```shell
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

it tells us everything is up to date.
If we want to know what we've done recently,
we can ask Git to show us the project's history using `git log`:

```shell
$ git log
```

```text
commit f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b
Author: Vlad Dracula <vlad@tran.sylvan.ia>
Date:   Thu Aug 22 09:51:46 2013 -0400

    Start notes on Mars as a base
```

`git log` lists all commits  made to a repository in reverse chronological order.
The listing for each commit includes
the commit's full identifier
(which starts with the same characters as
the short identifier printed by the `git commit` command earlier),
the commit's author,
when it was created,
and the log message Git was given when the commit was created.

> **Where Are My Changes?**
>
> If we run `ls` at this point, we will still see just one file called `mars.txt`.
> That's because Git saves information about files' history
> in the special `.git` directory mentioned earlier
> so that our filesystem doesn't become cluttered
> (and so that we can't accidentally edit or delete an old version).

Now suppose Dracula adds more information to the file.
(Again, we'll edit with `nano` and then `cat` the file to show its contents;
you may use a different editor, and don't need to `cat`.)

```shell
$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
```

```text
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
```

When we run `git status` now,
it tells us that a file it already knows about has been modified:

```shell
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   mars.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

The last line is the key phrase:
"no changes added to commit".
We have changed this file,
but we haven't told Git we will want to save those changes
(which we do with `git add`)
nor have we saved them (which we do with `git commit`).
So let's do that now. It is good practice to always review
our changes before saving them. We do this using `git diff`.
This shows us the differences between the current state
of the file and the most recently saved version:

```shell
$ git diff
```

```text
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index df0654a..315bf3a 100644
--- a/mars.txt
+++ b/mars.txt
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
 Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
+The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
```

The output is cryptic because
it is actually a series of commands for tools like editors and `patch`
telling them how to reconstruct one file given the other.
If we break it down into pieces:

1.  The first line tells us that Git is producing output similar to the Unix `diff` command
    comparing the old and new versions of the file.
2.  The second line tells exactly which versions of the file
    Git is comparing;
    `df0654a` and `315bf3a` are unique computer-generated labels for those versions.
3.  The third and fourth lines once again show the name of the file being changed.
4.  The remaining lines are the most interesting, they show us the actual differences
    and the lines on which they occur.
    In particular,
    the `+` marker in the first column shows where we added a line.

After reviewing our change, it's time to commit it:

```shell
$ git commit -m "Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman"
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   mars.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Whoops:
Git won't commit because we didn't use `git add` first.
Let's fix that:

```shell
$ git add mars.txt
$ git commit -m "Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman"
```

```text
[master 34961b1] Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

Git insists that we add files to the set we want to commit
before actually committing anything. This allows us to commit our
changes in stages and capture changes in logical portions rather than
only large batches.
For example,
suppose we're adding a few citations to relevant research to our thesis.
We might want to commit those additions,
and the corresponding bibliography entries,
but *not* commit some of our work drafting the conclusion
(which we haven't finished yet).

To allow for this,
Git has a special *staging area*
where it keeps track of things that have been added to nthe current changeset
but not yet committed.

> **Staging Area**
>
> If you think of Git as taking snapshots of changes over the life of a project,
> `git add` specifies *what* will go in a snapshot
> (putting things in the staging area),
> and `git commit` then *actually takes* the snapshot, and

*TODO: Figure - The Git Staging Area [../fig/git-staging-area.svg](https://github.com/swcarpentry/git-novice/blob/gh-pages/fig/git-staging-area.svg)*

Let's watch as our changes to a file move from our editor
to the staging area
and into long-term storage.
First,
we'll add another line to the file:

```shell
$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
```

```text
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
```

```shell
$ git diff

@@ -1,2 +1,3 @@

```

So far, so good:
we've added one line to the end of the file
(shown with a `+` in the first column).
Now let's put that change in the staging area
and see what `git diff` reports:

```shell
$ git add mars.txt
$ git diff
```

There is no output:
as far as Git can tell,
there's no difference between what it's been asked to save permanently
and what's currently in the directory.
However,
if we do this:

```shell
$ git diff --staged
```

```text

it shows us the difference between

Let's save our changes:

```shell
$ git commit -m "Discuss concerns about Mars' climate for Mummy"
```

```text

To recap, when we want to add changes to our repository,
we first need to add the changed files to the staging area
(`git add`) and then commit the staged changes to the
repository (`git commit`):

![The Git Commit Workflow](../fig/git-committing.svg)


## Exercises {#cmdline-git-exercises}

**Places to Create Git Repositories**

Along with tracking information about planets (the project we have already created), 
Dracula would also like to track information about moons.
Despite Wolfman's concerns, Dracula creates a `moons` project inside his `planets` 
project with the following sequence of commands:

```shell
$ cd ~/Desktop   # return to Desktop directory
$ cd planets     # go into planets directory, which is already a Git repository
$ ls -a          # ensure the .git sub-directory is still present in the planets directory
$ mkdir moons    # make a sub-directory planets/moons
$ cd moons       # go into moons sub-directory
$ git init       # make the moons sub-directory a Git repository
$ ls -a          # ensure the .git sub-directory is present indicating we have created a new Git repository
```

Is the `git init` command, run inside the `moons` sub-directory, required for 
tracking files stored in the `moons` sub-directory?
 
> *Solution*
>
> No. Dracula does not need to make the `moons` sub-directory a Git repository 
> because the `planets` repository will track all files, sub-directories, and 
> sub-directory files under the `planets` directory.  Thus, in order to track 
> all information about moons, Dracula only needed to add the `moons` sub-directory
> to the `planets` directory.
> 
> Additionally, Git repositories can interfere with each other if they are "nested":
> the outer repository will try to version-control
> the inner repository. Therefore, it's best to create each new Git
> repository in a separate directory. To be sure that there is no conflicting
> repository in the directory, check the output of `git status`. If it looks
> like the following, you are good to go to create a new repository as shown
> above:
>
> ```shell
> $ git status
> ```
>
> ```text
> fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
> ```


**Correcting `git init` Mistakes**

Wolfman explains to Dracula how a nested repository is redundant and may cause confusion
down the road. Dracula would like to remove the nested repository. How can Dracula undo 
his last `git init` in the `moons` sub-directory?

> *Background*
> 
> Removing files from a git repository needs to be done with caution. To remove files from the working tree and not from your working directory, use
> 
> ```shell
> $ rm filename
> ```
> 
> The file being removed has to be in sync with the branch head with no updates.
> If there are updates, the file can be removed by force by using the `-f` option.
> Similarly a directory can be removed from git using `rm -r dirname` or `rm -rf dirname`.
>
> *Solution - USE WITH CAUTION*
>
> Git keeps all of its files in the `.git` directory.
> To recover from this little mistake, Dracula can just remove the `.git`
> folder in the moons subdirectory by running the following command from inside the `planets` directory:
>
> ```shell
> $ rm -rf moons/.git
> ```
>

> ## Choosing a Commit Message
>
> Which of the following commit messages would be most appropriate for the
> last commit made to `mars.txt`?
>
> 1. "Changes"
> 2. "Added line 'But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity' to mars.txt"
> 3. "Discuss effects of Mars' climate on the Mummy"
>
> > ## Solution
> > Answer 1 is not descriptive enough, and the purpose of the commit is unclear;
> > and answer 2 is redundant to using "git diff" to see what changed in this commit;
> > but answer 3 is good: short, descriptive, and imperative.

> ## Committing Changes to Git
>
> Which command(s) below would save the changes of `myfile.txt`
> to my local Git repository?
>
> 1. ```
>    $ git commit -m "my recent changes"
>    ```
>    {: .language-bash}
> 2. ```
>    $ git init myfile.txt
>    $ git commit -m "my recent changes"
>    ```
>    {: .language-bash}
> 3. ```
>    $ git add myfile.txt
>    $ git commit -m "my recent changes"
>    ```
>    {: .language-bash}
> 4. ```
>    $ git commit -m myfile.txt "my recent changes"
>    ```
>    {: .language-bash}
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > 1. Would only create a commit if files have already been staged.
> > 2. Would try to create a new repository.
> > 3. Is correct: first add the file to the staging area, then commit.
> > 4. Would try to commit a file "my recent changes" with the message myfile.txt.

> ## Committing Multiple Files
>
> The staging area can hold changes from any number of files
> that you want to commit as a single snapshot.
>
> 1. Add some text to `mars.txt` noting your decision
> to consider Venus as a base
> 2. Create a new file `venus.txt` with your initial thoughts
> about Venus as a base for you and your friends
> 3. Add changes from both files to the staging area,
> and commit those changes.
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > First we make our changes to the `mars.txt` and `venus.txt` files:
> > ```
> > $ nano mars.txt
> > $ cat mars.txt
> > ```
> > {: .language-bash}
> > ```
> > Maybe I should start with a base on Venus.
> > ```
> > {: .output}
> > ```
> > $ nano venus.txt
> > $ cat venus.txt
> > ```
> > {: .language-bash}
> > ```
> > Venus is a nice planet and I definitely should consider it as a base.
> > ```
> > {: .output}
> > Now you can add both files to the staging area. We can do that in one line:
> >
> > ```
> > $ git add mars.txt venus.txt
> > ```
> > {: .language-bash}
> > Or with multiple commands:
> > ```
> > $ git add mars.txt
> > $ git add venus.txt
> > ```
> > {: .language-bash}
> > Now the files are ready to commit. You can check that using `git status`. If you are ready to commit use:
> > ```
> > $ git commit -m "Write plans to start a base on Venus"
> > ```
> > {: .language-bash}
> > ```
> > [master cc127c2]
> >  Write plans to start a base on Venus
> >  2 files changed, 2 insertions(+)
> >  create mode 100644 venus.txt

> ## `bio` Repository
>
> * Create a new Git repository on your computer called `bio`.
