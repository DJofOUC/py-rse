- Introduction  
  - Explain how the shell relates to the keyboard, the screen, the operating system, and users' programs.
  - Explain when and why command-line interfaces should be used instead of graphical interfaces.
  - Explain the steps in the shell's read-run-print cycle.
  - Identify the actual command, options, and filenames in a command-line call.
  - Demonstrate the use of tab completion and explain its advantages.

- Navigating files and directories  
  - Explain the similarities and differences between a file and a directory.
  - Translate an absolute path into a relative path and vice versa.
  - Construct absolute and relative paths that identify specific files and directories.

- Working with files and directories  
  - Create a directory hierarchy that matches a given diagram.
  - Create files in that hierarchy using an editor or by copying and renaming existing files.
  - Delete, copy and move specified files and/or directories.

- Pipes and filters  
  - Redirect a command's output to a file.
  - Process a file instead of keyboard input using redirection.
  - Construct command pipelines with two or more stages.
  - Explain what usually happens if a program or pipeline isn't given any input to process.
  - Explain Unix's 'small pieces, loosely joined' philosophy.

- Loops  
  - Write a loop that applies one or more commands separately to each file in a set of files.
  - Trace the values taken on by a loop variable during execution of the loop.
  - Explain the difference between a variable's name and its value.
  - Explain why spaces and some punctuation characters shouldn't be used in file names.
  - Demonstrate how to see what commands have recently been executed.
  - Re-run recently executed commands without retyping them.

- Shell scripts  
  - Write a shell script that runs a command or series of commands for a fixed set of files.
  - Run a shell script from the command line.
  - Write a shell script that operates on a set of files defined by the user on the command line.
  - Create pipelines that include shell scripts you, and others, have written.

- Finding things  
  - Use `grep` to select lines from text files that match simple patterns.
  - Use `find` to find files whose names match simple patterns.
  - Use the output of one command as the command-line argument(s) to another command.
  - Explain what is meant by 'text' and 'binary' files, and why many common tools don't handle the latter well.
