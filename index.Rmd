Software is now as essential to research as telescopes, test tubes, and reference libraries.
This means that researchers *need* to know how to build, check, use, and share programs.
However,
most introductions to programming focus on developing commercial applications,
not on exploring problems whose answers aren't yet known.
Our goal is to show you how to do that,
both on your own and as part of a team.

We believe every researcher should know
how to write short programs that clean and analyze data in a reproducible way
and how to use version control to keep track of what they have done.
But just as some astronomers spend their careers designing telescopes,
some researchers focus on building the software that makes research possible.
People who do this are called \gref{research software engineers}{rse};
the aim of this book is to get you ready for this role by helping you go from
writing code for yourself to creating tools to helping your entire field advance.

## The Big Picture {#intro-big-picture}

Our approach to research software engineering is based on three related concepts:

-   \gref{Open science}{open_science}: Making data, methods, and results
    freely available to all by publishing them under \gref{open
    licenses}{open_license}.

-   \gref{Reproducible research}{reproducible_research}: Ensuring that anyone
    with access to the data and software can feasibly reproduce results, both to
    check them and to build on them. 

-   \gref{Sustainable}{sustainable_software} software: The ease with which to
    maintain and extend it rather than to replace it.  Sustainability isn't
    just a property of the software: it also depends on the skills and culture
    of its users.

People often conflate these three ideas,
but they are distinct.
For example,
if you share your data and the programs that analyze it,
but don't document what steps to take in what order,
your work is open but not reproducible.
Conversely,
if you completely automate your analysis,
but your data is only available to people in your lab,
your work is reproducible but not open.
Finally,
if a software package is being maintained by a couple of post-docs
who are being paid a fraction of what they could earn in industry
and have no realistic hope of promotion because their field doesn't value tool building,
then sooner or later it will become \gref{abandonware}{abandonware},
at which point openness and reproducibility become less relevant.

Nobody argues that research should be irreproducible or unsustainable,
but "not against it" and actively supporting it are very different things.
Academia doesn't yet know how to reward people for writing useful software,
so while you may be thanked,
the effort you put in may not translate into academic job security or decent pay.

Some people worry that if they make their data and code publicly available,
someone else will use it and publish a result they have come up with themselves.
This is almost unheard of in practice,
but that doesn't stop it being used as a scare tactic.
Other people are afraid of looking foolish or incompetent by sharing code that might contain bugs.
This isn't just \gref{impostor syndrome}{impostor_syndrome}:
members of marginalized groups are frequently judged more harshly than others,
so being wrong in public is much riskier for them.

With this course, we hope to give researchers the tools and knowledge to be
better research software developers, to be more efficient in their work, make
less mistakes, and work more openly and reproducibly.
We hope that by having more researchers with these skills and knowledge,
research culture can improve to address the issues raised above.

## Using this book

This book is meant to be used as the material for (potentially) semester
long course at the university level. 
The course is designed with using participatory live-coding as the style
for teaching the material and code, rather than as lectures talking about them.
The chapters and their content are generally designed to be used in the order
given.

Chapters are structured with the introduction at the start, content in the middle,
and exercises at the end. Callout boxes are interspersed throughout the content
to be used as a supplement to the main text, but not a requirement for the course
overall.
While the exercises are at the end of each chapter, we recommend that the
exercises are used throughout the lessons and not used at the end of the lesson.
Possible exercise solutions are found in Appendix \@ref(solutions).

-   Many of the explanations and exercises in Chapters \@ref(bash-basics)--\@ref(bash-advanced)
    have been adapted from Software Carpentry's lesson
    [The Unix Shell][swc-shell-novice].

-   Many of explanations and exercises in Chapters \@ref(git-cmdline) and \@ref(git-advanced)
    have been adapted from Software Carpentry's lesson
    [Version Control with Git][swc-git] and an
    [adaptation/extension of that lesson][uwm-git-lesson] maintained by
    the University of Wisconsin-Madison Data Science Hub.

-   Chapter \@ref(automate) is based on the [Software Carpentry lesson on Make][swc-make]
    maintained by [Gerard Capes][capes-gerard]
    and on [Jonathan Dursi][dursi-jonathan]'s
    [introduction to pattern rules][dursi-pattern-rules].

-   Chapter \@ref(packaging) is based in part on [Python 102][python-102]
